HISTORY CHAPTER LXXIV OF HOW DON QUIXOTE FELL SICK AND OF THE WILL HE MADE AND HOW HE DIED INTRODUCTION PREFARATORY It was with csiderable reluctce that I abded favour of the prest dertakg what had lg be a favourite project that of aew editi of Shelt’s “D Quixote ” which hasow become a somewhat scarce book There are some—d I cfess myself to be e—for whom Shelt’s racy old versi with all its defects has a charm thato mode trslati however skilful or correct could possess Shelt had the estimable advtage of belgg to the same gerati as Cervtes “D Quixote” had to him a vitality that ly a ctemporary could feel it cost himo dramatic effort to see thgs as Cervtes saw them there iso achrism his lguage he put the Spish of Cervtes to the glish of Shakespeare Shakespeare himself most likely ew the book he may have carried it home with him his saddle bags to Stratford e of his last joueys d der the mulberry tree at New Place joed hds with a kdred gius its pages But it was so made pla to me that to hope for ev a moderate popularity for Shelt was va His fe old crusted glish would o doubt be relished by a mority but it would be ly by a mority His warmest admirers must admit that he isot a satisfactory represtative of Cervtes His trslati of the First Part was very hastily made d wasever revised by him It has all the fresess d vigour but also a full measure of the faults of a hasty producti It is oft very literal—barbarously literal frequtly—but just as oft very loose He had evidtly a good colloquial owledge of Spish but appartlyot much more Itever seems to occur to him that the same trslati of a word willot suit every case It is oft said that we haveo satisfactory trslati of “D Quixote ” To those who are familiar with the origal it savours of truism or platitude to say so for truth there c beo thoroughly satisfactory trslati of “D Quixote” to glish or y other lguage It isot that the Spish idioms are so utterly mageable or that the trslatable words umerous ougho doubt are so superabdt but rather that the sttious tersess to which the humour of the book owes its flavour is peculiar to Spish d c at best be ly disttly imitated y other tgue The history of our glish trslatis of “D Quixote” is structive Shelt’s the first y lguage was made appartly about butot published till This of course was ly the First Part It has be asserted that the Secd published isot the work of Shelt but there isothg to support the asserti save the fact that it has less spirit less of what we gerally derstd by “go ” about it th the first which would be lyatural if the first were the work of a yog m writg currte calamo d the secd that of a middle aged m writg for a bookseller the other hd it is closer d more literal the style is the same the very same trslatis or mistrslatis occur it d it is extremely likely that aew trslator would by suppressg hisame have allowed Shelt to carry off the credit Jo Phillips Milt’sephew produced a “D Quixote” “made glish ” he says “accordg to the humour of our mode lguage ” His “Quixote” isot so much a trslati as a travesty d a travesty that for coarsess vulgarity d buffoery is almost exampled ev the literature of that day Ned Ward’s “Life d Notable Advtures of D Quixote merrily trslated to Hudibrastic Verse” c scarcely be recked a trslati but it serves to show the light which “D Quixote” was regarded at the time A further illustrati may be fod the versi published by Peter Motteux who had th rectly combed tea dealg with literature It is described as “trslated from the origal by several hds ” but if so all Spish flavour has tirely evaporated der the mipulati of the several hds The flavour that it has the other hd is distctly Frco cocey ye who compares it carefully with the origal will have little doubt that it is a ccocti from Shelt d the Frch of Filleau de Sat Mart eked out by borrowgs from Phillips whose mode of treatmt it adopts It is to be sure more dect d decorous but it treats “D Quixote” the same fashi as a comic book that cnot be made too comic To attempt to improve the humour of “D Quixote” by fusi of cocey flippcy d facetiouess as Motteux’s operators did isot merely impertce like lardg a sirlo of prize beef but absolute falsificati of the spirit of the book d it is a proof of the critical way which “D Quixote” is gerally read that this worse th worthless trslati—worthless as failg to represt worse th worthless as misreprestg—should have be favoured as it has be It had the effect however of brgg out a trslati dertak d executed a very differt spirit that of Charles Jervas the portrait pater d frid of Pope Swift Arbutot d Gay Jervas has be allowed little credit for his work deed it may be saide for it is o to the world geral as Jarvis’s It wasot published til after his death d the prters gave theame accordg to the currt prciati of the day It has be the most freely used d the most freely abused of all the trslatis It has se far more editis th y other it is admitted all hds to be by far the most faithful d yetobody seems to have a good word to say for it or for its author Jervaso doubt prejudiced readers agast himself his preface where amg my true words about Shelt Stevs d Motteux he rashly d justly charges Shelt with havg trslatedot from the Spish but from the Itali versi of Frciosi which didot appear til t years after Shelt’s first volume A suspici of competce too seems to have attached to him because he was by professi a pater d a mediocre e though he has giv us the best portrait we have of Swift d this may have be strgthed by Pope’s remark that he “trslated ‘D Quixote’ without derstdg Spish ” He has be also charged with borrowg from Shelt whom he disparaged It is true that a few difficult or obscure passages he has followed Shelt d ge astray with him but for e case of this sort there are fifty where he is right d Shelt wrg As for Pope’s dictum ye who exames Jervas’s versi carefully side by side with the origal will see that he was a sod Spish scholar comparably a better e th Shelt except perhaps mere colloquial Spish He was fact hest faithful d pastakg trslator d he has left a versi which whatever its shortcomgs may be is sgularly free from errors d mistrslatis The charge agast it is that it is stiff dry—“wood” a word —do e c dy that there is a fodati for it But it may be pleaded for Jervas that a good deal of this rigidity is due to his abhorrce of the light flippt jocose style of his predecessors He was e of the few very few trslators that have sho y apprehsi of the smilg gravity which is the essce of Quixotic humour it seemed to him a crime to brg Cervtes forward smirkg d grng at his o good thgs d to this may be attributed a great measure the ascetic abstce from everythg savourg of liveless which is the characteristic of his trslati most mode editis it should be observed his style has be smoothed d smarted but without y referce to the origal Spish so that if he has be made to read more agreeably he has also be robbed of his chief merit of fidelity Smollett’s versi published may be almost coted as e of these At y rate it is pla that its cstructi Jervas’s trslati was very freely dra up d very little or probablyo heed giv to the origal Spish The later trslatis may be dismissed a few words George Kelly’s which appeared “prted for the Trslator ” was impudt imposture begothg more th Motteux’s versi with a few of the words here d there artfully trsposed Charles Wilmot’s was ly abridgmt like Flori’s butot so skilfully executed d the versi published by Miss Smirke to accompy her brother’s plates was merely a patchwork producti made out of former trslatis the latest Mr A J Duffield’s it would be every sse of the word impertt me to offer opi here I hadot ev se it wh the prest dertakg was proposed to me d sce th I may say vidi ttum havg for obvious reass resisted the temptati which Mr Duffield’s reputati d comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervtes From the foregog history of our trslatis of “D Quixote ” it will be se that there are a good my people who provided they get the merearrative with its full complemt of facts cidts d advtures served up to them a form that amuses them care very little whether that form is the e which Cervtes origally shaped his ideas the other hd it is clear that there are my who desire to haveot merely the story he tells but the story as he tells it so far at least as differces of idiom d circumstces permit d who will give a preferce to the cscitious trslator ev though he may have acquitted himself somewhat awkwardly But after all there iso real tagism betwe the two classes there iso reas why what pleases the e shouldot please the other or why a trslator who makes it his aim to treat “D Quixote” with the respect due to a great classic shouldot be as acceptable ev to the careless reader as the e who treats it as a famous old jest book It isot a questi of caviare to the geral or if it is the fault rests with him who makes so The method by which Cervtes w the ear of the Spish people ought mutatis mutdis to be equally effective with the great majority of glish readers At y rate ev if there are readers to whom it is a matter of differce fidelity to the method is as much a part of the trslator’s duty as fidelity to the matter If he c please all parties so much the better but his first duty is to those who look to him for as faithful a represtati of his author as it is his power to give them faithful to the letter so lg as fidelity is practicable faithful to the spirit so far as he c make it My purpose here isot to dogmatise the rules of trslati but to dicate those I have followed or at least tried to the best of my ability to follow the prest stce e which it seems to me cnot be too rigidly followed trslatg “D Quixote ” is to avoid everythg that savours of

laid up the Morisco Chap IXot to omit or add ythg CERVANTES Four geratis had laughed over “D Quixote” before it occurred to ye to ask who d what mner of m was this Miguel de Cervtes Saavedra whoseame is the title page d it was too late for a satisfactory swer to the questi wh it was proposed to add a life of the author to the Ld editi published at Lord Carteret’s stce All traces of the persality of Cervtes had by that time disappeared y floatg traditis that may ce have existed trsmitted from m who had o him had lg sce died out d of other record there wase for the sixteth d sevteth cturies were curious as to “the m of the time ” a reproach agast which theeteth has at y rate secured itself if it has producedo Shakespeare or Cervtes All that Mays y Siscar to whom the task was trusted or y of those who followed him Rios Pellicer or Navarrete could do was to eke out the few allusis Cervtes makes to himself his various prefaces with such pieces of documtary evidce bearg up his life as they could fd This however has be de by the lastamed biographer to such good purpose that he has superseded all predecessors Thorougess is the chief characteristic of Navarrete’s work Besides siftg testg d methodisg with rare patice d judgmt what had be previously brought to light he left as the sayg is o ste tued der which ythg to illustrate his subject might possibly be fod Navarrete has de all that dustry d acum could do d it iso fault of his if he hasot giv us what we wt What Hallam says of Shakespeare may be applied to the almost parallel case of Cervtes “It isot the register of his baptism or the draft of his will or the orthography of hisame that we seek o letter of his writg o record of his cversati o character of him dra by a ctemporary has be produced ” It is lyatural therefore that the biographers of Cervtes forced to make brick without straw should have recourse largely to cjecture d that cjecture should some stces come by degrees to take the place of established fact All that I propose to do here is to separate what is matter of fact from what is matter of cjecture d leave it to the reader’s judgmt to decide whether the data justify the ferce orot The m

date but I thk the balce of the evidce tds to show that the “solar ” the origal site of the family was at Cervatos theorth west coer of Old Castile close to the jcti of Castile Le d the Asturias As it

the days of photographs my first fcies regardg what they were like were reasably derived from their tombstes The shape of the letters my father’s gave me odd idea that he was a square stout dark m

But prestly I looked over my shoulder d saw him gog aga towards the river still huggg himself both arms d pickg his way with his sore feet amg the great stes dropped to the marshes here d there for

heavy hd d to be much the habit of layg it up her husbd as well as up me I supposed that Joe Gargery d I were both brought up by hd She wasot a good lookg wom my sister d I had a geral impressi that she must have made Joe Gargery marry her by hd Joe was a fair m with curls of flax hair each side of his smooth face d with eyes of such a very decided blue that they seemed to have somehow got mixed with their o whites He was a mild goodatured sweet tempered easy gog foolish dear fellow —a sort of Hercules strgth d also weaess My sister Mrs Joe with black hair d eyes had such a prevailg reess of sk that I sometimes used to wder whether it was possible she washed herself with autmeg grater stead of soap She was tall d by d almost always wore a coarse apr fasted over her figure behd with two loops d havg a square impreable bib frt that was stuck full of ps deedles She made it a powerful merit herself d a strg reproach agast Joe that she wore this apr so much Though I really seeo reas why she should have wo it at all or why if she did wear it at all she shouldot have tak it off every day of her life Joe’s forge adjoed our house which was a wood house as my of the dwellgs our cotry were —most of them at that time Wh I r home from the churchyard the forge was shut up d Joe was sittg ale the kitch Joe d I beg fellow sufferers d havg cfidces as such Joe imparted a cfidce to me the momt I raised the latch of the door d peeped at him opposite to it sittg the chiey coer “Mrs Joe has be out a doz times lookg for you Pip d she’s outow makg it a baker’s doz ” “Is she ” “Yes Pip ” said Joe “d what’s worse she’s got Tickler with her ” At this dismal telligce I twisted the ly butt my waistcoat rod d rod d looked great depressi at the fire Tickler was a wax ded piece of ce wo smooth by collisi with my tickled frame “She sot do ” said Joe “d she got up d she made a grab at Tickler d she Ram paged out That’s what she did ” said Joe slowly clearg the fire betwe the lower bars with the

Ram page this last spell about five mutes Pip She’s a comg Get behd the door old chap d have the jack towel betwixt you ” I took the advice My sister Mrs Joe throwg the door wide op d fdg obstructi behd it immediately dived the cause d applied Tickler to its further vestigati She ccluded by throwg me—I oft served as a cnubial missile—at Joe who glad to get hold of me y terms passed me to the chiey d quietly fced me up there with his great leg “Where have you be you yog mkey ” said Mrs Joe stampg her foot “Tell me directly what you’ve be dog to wear me away with fret d fright d worrit or I’d have you out of that coer if you was fifty Pips d he was five hdred Gargerys ” “I have ly be to the churchyard ” said I from my stool cryg d rubbg myself “Churchyard ” repeated my sister “If it wa’t for me you’d have be to the churchyard lg ago d stayed there Who brought you up by hd ” “You did ” said I “d why did I do it I should like to ow ” exclaimed my sister I whimpered “I d’t ow ” “ I d’t ” said my sister “I’dever do it aga I ow that I may truly say I’veever had this apr of me off sce bo you were It’s bad ough to be a blacksmith’s wife d him a Gargery without beg your mother ” My thoughts strayed from that questi as I looked discsolately at the fire For the fugitive out the marshes with the ired leg the mysterious yog m the file the food d the dreadful pledge I was der to commit a larcy those shelterg premises rose before me the avgg coals “Hah ” said Mrs Joe restorg Tickler to his stati “Churchyard deed You may well say churchyard you two ” e of us by the by hadot said it at all “You’ll drive me to the churchyard betwixt you e of these days d O a pr r recious pair you’d be without me ” As she applied herself to set the tea thgs Joe peeped do at me over his leg as if he were mtally castg me d himself up d calculatg what kd of pair we practically should make der the grievous circumstces foreshadowed After that he sat feelg his right side flax curls d whisker d followg Mrs Joe about with his blue eyes as his mner always was at squally times My sister had a trcht way of cuttg our bread d butter for us thatever varied First with her left hd she jammed the loaf hard d fast agast her bib —where it sometimes got a p to it d sometimes aeedle which we afterwards got to our mouths Th she took some butter ot too much a ife d spread it the loaf apothecary kd of way as if she were makg a plaster —usg both sides of the ife with a slappg dexterity d trimmg d mouldg the butter off rod the crust Th she gave the ife a fal smart wipe the edge of the plaster d th sawed a very thick rod off the loaf which she fally before separatg from the loaf hewed to two halves of which Joe got e d I the other the prest occasi though I was hgry I daredot eat my slice I felt that I must have somethg reserve for my dreadful acquatce d his ally the still more dreadful yog m I ew Mrs Joe’s housekeepg to be of the strictest kd d that my larcous researches might fdothg available the safe Therefore I resolved to put my hk of bread d butter do the leg of my trousers The effort of resolutiecessary to the achievemt of this purpose I fod to be quite awful It was as if I had to make up my md to leap from the top of a high house or plge to a great depth of water d it was made the more difficult by the cscious Joe our already mtied freemasry as fellow sufferers d his goodatured compiship with me it was our evg habit to compare the way we bit through our slices by siltly holdg them up to each other’s admiratiow d th —which stimulated us toew exertis Toight Joe several times vited me by the display of his fast dimishg slice to ter up our usual fridly competiti but he fod me each time with my yellow mug of tea e ee d my touched bread d butter the other At last I desperately csidered that the thg I ctemplated must be de d that it had best be de the least improbable mner csistt with the circumstces I took advtage of a momt wh Joe had just looked at me d got my bread d butter do my leg Joe was evidtly made comfortable by what he supposed to be my loss of appetite d took a thoughtful bite out of his slice which he di’t seem to joy He tued it about his mouth much lger th usual pderg over it a good deal d after all gulped it do like a pill He was about to take other bite d had just got his head e side for a good purchase it wh his eye fell me d he saw that my bread d butter was ge The wder d csteati with which Joe stopped the threshold of his bite d stared at me were too evidt to escape my sister’s observati “What’s the matter ow ” said she smartly as she put do her cup “I say you ow ” muttered Joe shakg his head at me very serious remstrce “Pip old chap You’ll do yourself a mischief It’ll stick somewhere You c’t have chawed it Pip ” “What’s the matterow ” repeated my sister more sharply th before “If you c cough y trifle it up Pip I’d recommd you to do it ” said Joe all aghast “Mners is mners but still your elth’s your elth ” By this time my sister was quite desperate so she poced Joe d takg him by the two whiskers ocked his head for a little while agast the wall behd him while I sat the coer lookg guiltily “Now perhaps you’ll mti what’s the matter ” said my sister out of breath “you starg great stuck pig ” Joe looked at her a helpless way th took a helpless bite d looked at me aga “You ow Pip ” said Joe solely with his last bite his cheek d speakg a cfidtial voice as if we two were quite ale “you d me is always frids d I’d be the last to tell up you y time But such a—” he moved his chair d looked about the floor betwe us d th aga at me—“such a most comm Bolt as that ” “Be boltg his food has he ” cried my sister “You ow old chap ” said Joe lookg at me dot at Mrs Joe with his bite still his cheek “I Bolted myself wh I was your age—frequt—d as a boy I’ve be amg a my Bolters but Iever see your Boltg equal yet Pip d it’s a mercy you a’t Bolted dead ” My sister made a dive at me d fished me up by the hair saygothg more th the awful words “You come alg d be dosed ” Some medical beast had revived Tar water those days as a fe medice d Mrs Joe always kept a supply of it the cupboard havg a belief its virtues correspdt to itsastess At the best of times so much of this elixir was admistered to me as a choice restorative that I was cscious of gog about smellg like aew fce this particular evg the urgcy of my case demded a pt of this mixture which was poured do my throat for my greater comfort while Mrs Joe held my head der her arm as a boot would be held a bootjack Joe got off with half a pt but was made to swallow that much to his disturbce as he sat slowly mchg d meditatg before the fire “because he had had a tu ” Judgg from myself I should say he certaly had a tu afterwards if he had hade before Cscice is a dreadful thg wh it accuses m or boy but wh the case of a boy that secret burd co operates with other secret burd do the leg of his trousers it is as I c testify a great pishmt The guilty owledge that I was gog to rob Mrs Joe—Iever thought I was gog to rob Joe for Iever thought of y of the housekeepg property as his—ited to theecessity of always keepg e hd my bread d butter as I sat or wh I was ordered about the kitch y small errd almost drove me out of my md Th as the marsh wds made the fire glow d flare I thought I heard the voice outside of the m with the ir his leg who had swo me to secrecy declarg that he coul’t d woul’t starve til to morrow but must be fedow At other times I thought What if the yog m who was with so much difficulty restraed from imbrug his hds me should yield to a cstitutial impatice or should mistake the time d should thk himself accredited to my heart d liver toight stead of to morrow If ever ybody’s hair stood d with terror me must have de so th But perhaps obody’s ever did It was Christmas Eve d I had to stir the puddg forext day with a copper stick from sev to eight by the Dutch clock I tried it with the load up my leg d that made me thk afresh of the m with the load his leg d fod the tdcy of exercise to brg the bread d butter out at my kle quite mageable Happily I slipped away d deposited that part of my cscice my garret

said I Mrs Joe who always took explatis up herself said appishly “Escaped Escaped ” Admisterg the defiti like Tar water While Mrs Joe sat with her head bdg over hereedlework I put my mouth to the forms of sayg to Joe “What’s a cvict ” Joe put his mouth to the forms of retug such a highly elaborate swer that I could make outothg of it but the sgle word “Pip ” “There was a cwict off lastight ” said Joe aloud “after sset g d they fired wag of him dow it appears they’re firg wag of other ” “ Who’s firg ” said I “Drat that boy ” terposed my sister frog at me over her work “what a questier he is Asko questis d you’ll be toldo lies ” It wasot very polite to herself I thought to imply that I should be told lies by her ev if I did ask questis But sheever was polite less there was compy At this pot Joe greatly augmted my curiosity by takg the utmost pas to op his mouth very wide d to put it to the form of a word that looked to me like “sulks ” Therefore Iaturally poted to Mrs Joe d put my mouth to the form of sayg “her ” But Joe woul’t hear of that at all d aga oped his mouth very wide d shook the form of a most emphatic word out of it But I could makeothg of the word “Mrs Joe ” said I as a last resort “I should like to ow—if you woul’t much md—where the firg comes from ” “Lord bless the boy ” exclaimed my sister as if she di’t quite me that but rather the ctrary “From the Hulks ” “Oh h ” said I lookg at Joe “Hulks ” Joe gave a reproachful cough as much as to say “Well I told you so ” “d please what’s Hulks ” said I “That’s the way with this boy ” exclaimed my sister potg me out with hereedle d thread d shakg her head at me “swer him e questi d he’ll ask you a doz directly Hulks are pris ships right ’cross th’ meshes ” We always used thatame for marshes our cotry “I wder who’s put to pris ships d why they’re put there ” said I a geral way d with quiet desperati It was too much for Mrs Joe who immediately rose “I tell you what yog fellow ” said she “I di’t brg you up by hd to badger people’s lives out It would be blame to me dot praise if I had People are put the Hulks because they murder d because they rob d forge d do all sorts of bad d they always beg by

I was mortal terror of my terlocutor with the ir leg I was mortal terror of myself from whom awful promise had be extracted I hado hope of deliverce through my all powerful sister who repulsed me at

disagreeable to a guilty md The gates d dikes d bks came burstg at me through the mist as if they cried as plaly as could be “A boy with somebody else’s pork pie Stop him ” The cattle came up me with like suddness starg out of their eyes d steamg out of theirostrils “Halloa yog thief ” e black ox with a white cravat —who ev had to my awaked cscice somethg of a clerical air —fixed me so obstately with his eyes d moved his blt head rod such accusatory mner as I moved rod that I blubbered out to him “I coul’t help it sir It wa’t for myself I took it ” Up which he put do his head blew a cloud of smoke out of hisose d vished with a kick up of his hd legs d a flourish of his tail All this time I was gettg towards the river but however fast I wt I coul’t warm my feet to which the damp cold seemed riveted as the ir was riveted to the leg of the m I was rng to meet I ew my way to the Battery pretty straight for I had be do there a Sday with Joe d Joe sittg old g had told me that wh I was ’prtice to him regularly bod we would have such Larks there However the cfusi of the mist I fod myself at last too far to the right d csequtly had to try back alg the river side the bk of loose stes above the mud d the stakes that staked the tide out Makg my way alg here with all despatch I had just crossed a ditch which I ew to be veryear the Battery d had just scrambled up the mod beyd the ditch wh I saw the m sittg before me His back was towards me d he had his arms folded d wasoddg forward heavy with sleep I thought he would be more glad if I came up him with his breakfast that expected mner so I wt forward softly d touched him the shoulder He sttly jumped up d it wasot the same m but other m d yet this m was dressed coarse grey too d had a great ir his leg d was lame d hoarse d cold d was everythg that the other m was except that he hadot the same face d had a flat broad brimmed low croed felt hat All this I saw a momt for I had ly a momt to see it he swore oath at me made a hit at me —it was a rod weak blow that missed me d almost ocked himself do for it made him stumble —d th he r to the mist stumblg twice as he wt d I lost him “It’s the yog m ” I thought feelg my heart shoot as I idtified him I dare say I should have felt a pa my liver too if I had o where it was I was so at the Battery after that d there was the right m —huggg himself d limpg to d fro as if he hadever allight left off huggg d limpg —waitg for me He was awfully cold to be sure I half expected to see him drop do before my face d die of deadly cold His eyes looked so awfully hgry too that wh I hded him the file d he laid it do theSQUIRE TRELAWNEY Dr Livesey d the rest of these gtlem havg asked me to write do the whole particulars about Treasure Isld from the begng to the d keepgothg back but the beargs of the isld d that ly because there is still treasureot yet lifted I take up my p the year of grace d go back to the time wh my father kept the Admiral Bbow n d the bro old seam with the sabre cut first took up his lodgg der our roof I remember him as if it were yesterday as he came ploddg to the n door his sea chest followg behd him a hd barrow a tall strg heavy ut bro m his tarry pigtail fallg over the shoulder of his soiled blue coat his hds ragged d scarred with black brokails d the sabre cut across e cheek a dirty livid white I remember him lookg rod the cove d whistlg to himself as he did so d th breakg out that old sea sg that he sg so oft afterwards “Fifte m the dead m’s chest Yo ho ho d a bottle of rum ” the high old totterg voice that seemed to have be ted d brok at the capst bars Th he rapped the door with a bit of stick like a hdspike that he carried d wh my father appeared called roughly for a glass of rum This wh it was brought to him he drk slowly like a cnoisseur lgerg the taste d still lookg about him at the cliffs d up at our siboard “This is a hdy cove ” says he at lgth “d a pleast sittyated grog shop Much compy mate ” My father told himo very little compy the more was the pity “Well th ” said he “this is the berth for me Here you matey ” he cried to the m who trdled the barrow “brg up algside d help up my chest I’ll stay here a bit ” he ctued “I’m a pla m rum d bac d eggs is what I wt d that head up there for to watch ships off What you mought call me You mought call me capta Oh I see what you’re at there” d he threw do three or four gold pieces the threshold “You c tell me wh I’ve worked through that ” says he lookg as fierce as a commder d deed bad as his clothes were d coarsely as he spoke he hade of the appearce of a m who sailed before the mast but seemed like a mate or skipper accustomed to be obeyed or to strike The m who came with the barrow told us the mail had set him do the mog before at the Royal George that he had quired what ns there were alg the coast d hearg ours well spok of I suppose d described as lely had chos it from the others for his place of residce d that was all we could lea of our guest He was a very silt m by custom All day he hg rod the cove or up the cliffs with a brass telescope all evg he sat a coer of the parlourext the fire d drk rum d water very strg Mostly he wouldot speak wh spok to ly look up sudd d fierce d blow through hisose like a fog ho d we d the people who came about our house so leaed to let him be Every day wh he came back from his stroll he would ask if y seafarg m had ge by alg the road At first we thought it was the wt of compy of his o kd that made him ask this questi but at last we beg to see he was desirous to avoid them Wh a seam did put up at the Admiral Bbow asow d th some did makg by the coast road for Bristol he would look at him through the curtaed door before he tered the parlour d he was always sure to be as silt as a mouse wh y such was prest For me at least there waso secret about the matter for I was a way a sharer his alarms He had tak me aside e day d promised me a silver fourpny the first of every mth if I would ly keep my “weather eye op for a seafarg m with e leg” d let him ow the momt he appeared Oft ough wh the first of the mth came rod d I applied to him for my wage he would ly blow through hisose at me d stare me do but before the week was out he was sure to thk better of it brg me my four pny piece d repeat his orders to look out for “the seafarg m with e leg ” How that persage hated my dreams Ieed scarcely tell you stormyights wh the wd shook the four coers of the house d the surf roared alg the cove d up the cliffs I would see him a thousd forms d with a thousd diabolical expressis Now the leg would be cut off at the ee ow at the hip ow he was a mstrous kd of a creature who hadever had but the e leg d that the middle of his body To see him leap d r d pursue me over hedge d ditch was the worst ofightmares d altogether I paid pretty dear for my mthly fourpny piece the shape of these abomable fcies But though I was so terrified by the idea of the seafarg m with e leg I was far less afraid of the capta himself th ybody else who ew him There wereights wh he took a deal more rum d water th his head would carry d th he would sometimes sit d sg his wicked old wild sea sgs mdgobody but sometimes he would call for glasses rod d force all the tremblg compy to list to his stories or bear a chorus to his sgg Oft I have heard the house shakg with “Yo ho ho d a bottle of rum ” all theeighbours jog for dear life with the fear of death up them d each sgg louder th the other to avoid remark For these fits he was the most overridg compi ever o he would slap his hd the table for silce all rod he would fly up a passi of ger at a questi or sometimes becausee was put d so he judged the compy wasot followg his story Nor would he allow ye to leave the n till he had drk himself sleepy d reeled off to bed His stories were what frighted people worst of all Dreadful stories they were about hgg d walkg the plk d storms at sea d the Dry Tortugas d wild deeds d places the Spish Ma By his o accot he must have lived his life amg some of the wickedest m that God ever allowed up the sea d the lguage which he told these stories shocked our pla cotry people almost as much as the crimes that he described My father was always sayg the n would be rued for people would so cease comg there to be tyrnized over d put do d st shiverg to their beds but I really believe his presce did us good People were frighted at the time but lookg back they rather liked it it was a fe excitemt a quiet cotry life d there was ev a party of the yoger m who pretded to admire him callg him a “true sea dog” d a “real old salt” d such likeames d sayg there was the sort of m that made gld terrible at sea e way deed he bade fair to ru us for he kept stayg week after week d at last mth after mth so that all the mey had be lg exhausted d still my fatherever plucked up the heart to sist havg more If ever he mtied it the capta blew through hisose so loudly that you might say he roared d stared my poor father out of the room I have se him wrgg his hds after such a rebuff d I am sure the noyce d the terror he lived must have greatly hasted his early d happy death All the time he lived with us the capta madeo chge whatever his dress but to buy some stockgs from a hawker e of the cocks of his hat havg fall do he let it hg from that day forth though it was a great noyce wh it blew I remember the appearce of his coat which he patched himself upstairs his room d which before the d wasothg but patches Heever wrote or received a letter d heever spoke with y but theeighbours d with these for the most part ly wh drk rum The great sea cheste of us had ever se op He was ly ce crossed d that was towards the d wh my poor father was far ge a decle that took him off Dr Livesey came late e afteo to see the patit took a bit of dner from my mother d wt to the parlour to smoke a pipe til his horse should come do from the hamlet for we hado stablg at the old Bbow I followed him d I remember observg the ctrast theeat bright doctor with his powder as white as ow d his bright black eyes d pleast mners made with the coltish cotry folk d above all with that filthy heavy bleared scarecrow of a pirate of ours sittg far ge rum with his arms the table Suddly he the capta that is beg to pipe up his eteal sg “Fifte m the dead m’s chest Yo ho ho d a bottle of rum Drk d the devil had de for the rest Yo ho ho d a bottle of rum ” At first I had supposed “the dead m’s chest” to be that idtical big box of his upstairs the frt room d the thought had be mgled myightmares with that of the e legged seafarg m But by this time we had all lg ceased to pay y particularotice to the sg it wasew thatight toobody but Dr Livesey d him I observed it didot produce agreeable effect for he looked up for a momt quite grily before he wt with his talk to old Taylor the garder aew cure for the rheumatics the metime the capta gradually brighted up at his o music d at last flapped his hd up the table before him a way we all ew to me silce The voices stopped at ce all but Dr Livesey’s he wt as before speakg clear d kd d drawg briskly at his pipe betwe every word or two The capta glared at him for a while flapped his hd aga glared still harder d at last broke out with a villaous low oath “Silce there betwe decks ” “Were you addressg me sir ” says the doctor d wh the ruffi had told him with other oath that this was so “I have ly e thg to say to you sir ” replies the doctor “that if you keep drkg rum the world will so be quit of a very dirty scodrel ” The old fellow’s fury was awful He sprg to his feet drew d oped a sailor’s clasp ife d balcg it op the palm of his hd threated to p the doctor to the wall The doctorever so much as moved He spoke to him as before over his shoulder d the same te of voice rather high so that all the room might hear but perfectly calm d steady “If you doot put that ife this stt your pocket I promise up my hour you shall hg at theext assizes ” Th followed a battle of looks betwe them but the capta so uckled der put up his weap d resumed his seat grumblg like a beat dog “dow sir ” ctued the doctor “sce Iow ow there’s such a fellow my district you may cot I’ll have eye up you day dight I’mot a doctor ly I’m a magistrate d if I catch a breath of complat agast you if it’s ly for a piece of civility like tight’s I’ll take effectual mes to have you hted do d routed out of this Let that suffice ” So after Dr Livesey’s horse came to the door d he rode away but the capta held his peace that evg d for my evgs to come Black Dog Appears d Disappears IT wasot very lg after this that there occurred the first of the mysterious evts that rid us at last of the capta thoughot as you will see of his affairs It was a bitter cold wter with lg hard frosts d heavy gales d it was pla from the first that my poor father was little likely to see the sprg He sk daily d my mother d I had all the n up our hds d were kept busy ough without payg much regard to our pleast guest It was e Juary mog very early a pchg frosty mog the cove all grey with hoar frost the ripple lappg softly the stes the s still low d ly touchg the hilltops d shg far to seaward The capta had ris earlier th usual d set out do the beach his cutlass swgg der the broad skirts of the old blue coat his brass telescope der his arm his hat tilted back up his head I remember his breath hgg like smoke his wake as he strode off d the last sod I heard of him as he tued the big rock was a loud ort of diati as though his md was still rng up Dr Livesey Well mother was upstairs with father d I was layg the breakfast table agast the capta’s retu wh the parlour door oped d a m stepped whom I hadever set my eyes before He was a pale tallowy creature wtg two fgers of the left hd d though he wore a cutlass he didot look much like a fighter I had always my eye op for seafarg m with e leg or two d I remember this e puzzled me He wasot sailorly d yet he had a smack of the sea about him too I asked him what was for his service d he said he would take rum but as I was gog out of the room to fetch it he sat do up a table d motied me to drawear I paused where I was with myapk my hd “Come here sny ” says he “Comeearer here ” I took a stepearer “Is this here table for my mate Bill ” he asked with a kd of leer I told him I didot ow his mate Bill d this was for a pers who stayed our house whom we called the capta “Well ” said he “my mate Bill would be called the capta as like asot He has a cut e cheek d a mighty pleast way with him particularly drk has my mate Bill We’ll put it for argumt like that your capta has a cut e cheek d we’ll put it if you like that that cheek’s the right e Ah well I told you Now is my mate Bill this here house ” I told him he was out walkg “Which way sny Which way is he ge ” d wh I had poted out the rock d told him how the capta was likely to retu d how so d swered a few other questis “Ah ” said he “this’ll be as good as drk to my mate Bill ” The expressi of his face as he said these words wasot at all pleast d I had my o reass for thkg that the strger was mistak ev supposg he met what he said But it waso affair of me I thought d besides it was difficult to ow what to do The strger kept hgg about just side the n door peerg rod the coer like a cat waitg for a mouse ce I stepped out myself to the road but he immediately called me back d as I didot obey quick ough for his fcy a most horrible chge came over his tallowy face d he ordered me with oath that made me jump As so as I was back aga he retued to his former mner half fag half eerg patted me the shoulder told me I was a good boy d he had tak quite a fcy to me “I have a s of my o ” said he “as like you as two blocks d he’s all the pride of my ’art But the great thg for boys is disciple sny disciple Now if you had sailed alg of Bill you woul’t have stood there to be spoke to twice ot you That wasever Bill’s way or the way of sich as sailed with him d here sure ough is my mate Bill with a spy glass der his arm bless his old ’art to be sure You d me’ll just go back to the parlour sny d get behd the door d we’ll give Bill a little surprise bless his ’art I say aga ” So sayg the strger backed alg with me to the parlour d put me behd him the coer so that we were both hidd by the op door I was very easy d alarmed as you may fcy d it rather added to my fears to observe that the strger was certaly frighted himself He cleared the hilt of his cutlass d loosed the blade the sheath d all the time we were waitg there he kept swallowg as if he felt what we used to call a lump the throat At last strode the capta slammed the door behd him without lookg to the right or left d marched straight across the room to where his breakfast awaited him “Bill ” said the strger a voice that I thought he had tried to make bold d big The capta sp rod his heel d frted us all the bro had ge out of his face d ev hisose was blue he had the look of a m who sees a ghost or the evil e or somethg worse if ythg c be d up my word I felt sorry to see him all a momt tu so old d sick “Come Bill you ow me you ow old shipmate Bill surely ” said the strger The capta made a sort of gasp “Black Dog ” said he “d who else ” retued the other gettg more at his ease “Black Dog as ever was come for to see his old shipmate Billy at the Admiral Bbow n Ah Bill Bill we have se a sight of times us two sce I lost them two tals ” holdg up his mutilated hd “Now look here ” said the capta “you’ve r me do here I am well th speak up what is it ” “That’s you Bill ” retued Black Dog “you’re the right of it Billy I’ll have a glass of rum from this dear child here as I’ve took such a likg to d we’ll sit do if you please d talk square like old shipmates ” Wh I retued with the rum they were already seated either side of the capta’s breakfast table Black Dogext to the door d sittg sideways so as to have e eye his old shipmate d e as I thought his retreat He bade me go d leave the door wide op “Ne of your keyholes for me sny ” he said d I left them together d retired to the bar For a lg time though I certaly did my best to list I could hearothg but a low gattlg but at last the voices beg to grow higher d I could pick up a word or two mostly oaths from the capta “No o o o d d of it ” he cried ce d aga “If it comes to swgg swg all say I ” Th all of a sudd there was a tremdous explosi of oaths d otheroises the chair d table wt over a lump a clash of steel followed d th a cry of pa d theext stt I saw Black Dog full flight d the capta hotly pursug both with dra cutlasses d the former streamg blood from the left shoulder Just at the door the capta aimed at the fugitive e last tremdous cut which would certaly have split him to the che had itot be tercepted by our big siboard of Admiral Bbow You may see theotch the lower side of the frame to this day That blow was the last of the battle ce out up the road Black Dog spite of his wod showed a wderful cle pair of heels d disappeared over the edge of the hill half a mute The capta for his part stood starg at the siboard like a bewildered m Th he passed his hd over his eyes several times d at last tued back to the house “Jim ” says he “rum” d as he spoke he reeled a little d caught himself with e hd agast the wall “Are you hurt ” cried I “Rum ” he repeated “I must get away from here Rum Rum ” I r to fetch it but I was quite steadied by all that had fall out d I broke e glass d fouled the tap d while I was still gettg my o way I heard a loud fall the parlour d rng beheld the capta lyg full lgth up the floor At the same stt my mother alarmed by the cries d fightg came rng dostairs to help me Betwe us we raised his head He was breathg very loud d hard but his eyes were closed d his face a horrible colour “Dear deary me ” cried my mother “what a disgrace up the house d your poor father sick ” the metime we hado idea what to do to help the capta or y other thought but that he had got his death hurt the scuffle with the strger I got the rum to be sure d tried to put it do his throat but his teeth were tightly shut d his jaws as strg as ir It was a happy relief for us wh the door oped d Doctor Livesey came his visit to my father “Oh doctor ” we cried “what shall we do Where is he woded ” “Woded A fiddle stick’s d ” said the doctor “No more woded th you or I The m has had a stroke as I waed him Now Mrs Hawks just you r upstairs to your husbd d tell him if possible othg about it For my part I must do my best to save this fellow’s trebly worthless life Jim you get me a bas ” Wh I got back with the bas the doctor had already ripped up the capta’s sleeve d exposed his great sewy arm It was tattooed several places “Here’s luck ” “A fair wd ” d “Billy Bes his fcy ” were veryeatly d clearly executed the forearm d upear the shoulder there was a sketch of a gallows d a m hgg from it de as I thought with great spirit “Prophetic ” said the doctor touchg this picture with his fger “dow Master Billy Bes if that be yourame we’ll have a look at the colour of your blood Jim ” he said “are you afraid of blood ” “No sir ” said I “Well th ” said he “you hold the bas” d with that he took his lcet d oped a ve A great deal of blood was tak before the capta oped his eyes d looked mistily about him First he recoized the doctor with mistakable fro th his glce fell up me d he looked relieved But suddly his colour chged d he tried to raise himself cryg “Where’s Black Dog ” “There iso Black Dog here ” said the doctor “except what you have your o back You have be drkg rum you have had a stroke precisely as I told you d I have just very much agast my o will dragged you headforemost out of the grave Now Mr Bes ” “That’sot myame ” he terrupted “Much I care ” retued the doctor “It’s theame of a bucceer of my acquatce d I call you by it for the sake of shoress d what I have to say to you is this e glass of rum w’t kill you but if you take e you’ll take other d other d I stake my wig if you d’t break off short you’ll die do you derstd that die d go to your o place like the m the Bible Come ow make effort I’ll help you to your bed for ce ” Betwe us with much trouble we maged to hoist him upstairs d laid him his bed where his head fell back the pillow as if he were almost fatg “Now md you ” said the doctor “I clear my cscice theame of rum for you is death ” d with that he wt off to see my father takg me with him by the arm “This isothg ” he said as so as he had closed the door “I have dra blood ough to keep him quiet awhile he should lie for a week where he is that is the best thg for him d you but other stroke would settle him ” The Black Spot ABOUTo I stopped at the capta’s door with some coolg drks d medices He was lyg very much as we had left him ly a little higher d he seemed both weak d excited “Jim ” he said “you’re the ly e here that’s worth ythg d you ow I’ve be always good to you Never a mth but I’ve giv you a silver fourpny for yourself dow you see mate I’m pretty low d deserted by all d Jim you’ll brg me eogg of rum ow w’t you matey ” “The doctor ” I beg But he broke cursg the doctor a feeble voice but heartily “Doctors is all swabs ” he said “d that doctor there why what do he ow about seafarg m I be places hot as pitch d mates droppg rod with Yellow Jack d the blessed ld a heavg like the sea with earthquakes what to the doctor ow of lds like that d I lived rum I tell you It’s be meat d drk d m d wife to me d if I’mot to have my rumow I’m a poor old hulk a lee shore my blood’ll be you Jim d that doctor swab” d he r aga for a

I’ll have the horrors I se some ’em already I se old Flt the coer there behd you as pla as prt I se him d if I get the horrors I’m a m that has lived rough d I’ll raise Ca Your doctor hisself said e glass woul’t hurt me I’ll give you a gold guea for aogg Jim ” He was growg more d more excited d this alarmed me for my father who was very low that day deeded quiet besides I was reassured by the doctor’s words ow quoted to me d rather offded by the offer of a bribe “I wte of your mey ” said I “but what you owe my father I’ll get you e glass do more ” Wh I brought it to him he seized it greedily d drk it out “Aye aye ” said he “that’s some better sure ough dow matey did that doctor say how lg I was to lie here this old berth ” “A week at least ” said I “Thder ” he cried “A week I c’t

wt to ow But I’m a savg soul Iever wasted good mey of me or lost iteither d I’ll trick ’em aga I’mot afraid ’em I’ll shake out other reef matey d daddle ’em aga ” As he was thus speakg he had ris from bed with great difficulty holdg to my shoulder with a grip that almost made me cry out d movg his legs like so much dead weight His words spirited as they were meg ctrasted sadly with the weaess of the voice which they were uttered He paused wh he had got to a sittg positi the edge “That doctor’s de me ” he murmured “My ears is sgg Lay me back ” Before I could do much to help him he had fall back aga to his former place where he lay for a while silt “Jim ” he said at lgth “you saw that seafarg m today ” “Black Dog ” I asked “Ah Black Dog ” says he “HE’S a bad but there’s worse that put him Now if I c’t get awayohow d they tip me the black spot md you it’s my old sea chest they’re after you get a horse you c c’t you Well th you get a horse d go to well yes I will to that eteal doctor

Jim him above all ” “But what is the black spot capta ” I asked “That’s a summs mate I’ll tell you if they get that But you keep your weather eye op Jim d I’ll share with you equals up my hour ” He wdered a little lger his voice growg weaker but so after I had giv him his medice which he took like a child with the remark “If ever a seam wted drugs it’s me ” he fell at last to a heavy swo like sleep which I left him What I should have de had all ge well I doot ow Probably I should have told the whole story to the doctor for I was mortal fear lest the capta should rept of his cfessis d make d of me But as thgs fell out my poor father died quite suddly that evg which put all other matters e side Ouratural distress the visits of theeighbours the arrgg of the feral d all the work of the n to be carried the mewhile kept me so busy that I had scarcely time to thk of the capta far less to be afraid of him He got dostairsext mog to be sure d had his meals as usual though he ate little d had more I am afraid th his usual supply of rum for he helped himself out of the bar scowlg d blowg through hisose do e dared to cross him theight before the feral he was as drk as ever d it was shockg that house of moug to hear him sgg away at his ugly old sea sg but weak as he was we were all the fear of death for him d the doctor was suddly tak up with a case my miles away d waseverear the house after my father’s death I have said the capta was weak d deed he seemed rather to grow weaker th rega his strgth He clambered up d do stairs d wt from the parlour to the bar d back aga d sometimes put hisose out of doors to smell the sea holdg to the walls as he wt for support d breathg hard d fast like a m a steep mota Heever particularly addressed me d it is my belief he had as good as forgott his cfidces but his temper was more flighty d allowg for his bodily weaess more violt th ever He had alarmg wayow wh he was drk of drawg his cutlass d layg it bare before him the table But with all that he mded people less d seemed shut up his o thoughts d rather wderg ce for stce to our extreme wder he piped up to a differt air a kd of cotry love sg that he must have leaed his youth before he had beg to follow the sea So thgs passed til the day after the feral d about three o’clock of a bitter foggy frosty afteo I was stdg at the door for a momt full of sad thoughts about my

GENTLEMAN STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH VERHOVENSKY I IN UNDERTAKING to describe the rect d strge cidts our to till lately wrapped evtful obscurity I fd myself forced absce of literary skill to beg my story rather far back that is to say with certa biographical details cceg that talted d highly esteemed gtlem Step Trofimovitch Verhovsky I trust that these details may at least serve as troducti while my projected story itself will come later I will say at ce that Step Trofimovitch had always filled a particular rôle amg us that of the progressive patriot so to say d he was passiately fd of playg the part so much so that I really believe he couldot have existed without it Not that I would put him a level with actor at a theatre God forbid for I really have a respect for him This may all have be the effect of habit or rather more exactly of a gerous propsity he had from his earliest years for dulgg agreeable day dream which he figured as a picturesque public character He fdly loved for stce his positi as a persecuted m d so to speak exile There is a sort of traditial glamour about those two little words that fascated him ce for all d exaltg him gradually his o opi raised him the course of years to a lofty pedestal very gratifyg to vity glish satire of the last ctury Gulliver retug from the ld of the Lilliputis where the people were ly three or four ches high had gro so accustomed to csider himself a git amg them that as he walked alg the streets of Ld he couldot help cryg out to carriages d passers by to be careful d get out of his way for fear he should crush them imagg that they were little d he was still a git He was laughed at d abused for it d rough coachm ev lashed at the git with their whips But was that just What mayot be de by habit Habit had brought Step Trofimovitch almost to the same positi but a more noct d offsive form if e may use such expressis for he was a most excellt m I am ev cled to suppose that towards the d he had be tirely forgott everywhere but still it cnot be said that hisame hadever be o It is beyd questi that he had at e time belged to a certa distguished cstellati of celebrated leaders of the last gerati d at e time though ly for the briefest momt hisame was proced by my hasty perss of that day almost as though it were a level with theames of Tchaadaev of Byelsky of Grovsky d of Herz who had ly just beg to write abroad But Step Trofimovitchs activity ceased almost at the momt it beg owg so to say to a vortex of combed circumstces d would you believe it It tued out afterwards that there had beo vortex d evo circumstces at least that cnecti I ly leaed the other day to my tse amazemt though the most impeachable authority that Step Trofimovitch had lived amg us our provceot as exile as we were accustomed to believe d hadever ev be der police supervisi at all Such is the force of imagati All his life he scerely believed that certa spheres he was a cstt cause of apprehsi that every step he took was watched doted d that each e of the three goveors who succeeded e other durg twty years our provce came with special d easy ideas cceg him which had by higher powers be impressed up each before everythg else receivg the appotmt Had ye assured the hest m the most irrefutable grods that he hadothg to be afraid of he would certaly have be offded Yet Step Trofimovitch was a most telligt d gifted m ev so to say a m of scice though deed scice well fact he hadot de such great thgs scice I believe deed he had deothg at all But thats very oft the case of course with m of scice amg us Russia He came back from abroad d was brillit the capacity of lecturer at the iversity towards the d of the forties He ly had time to deliver a few lectures I believe they were about the Arabs he mataed too a brillit thesis the political d Hseatic importce of the Germ to Hau of which there was promise the epoch betwe d d the special d obscure reass why that promise wasever fulfilled This dissertati was a cruel d skilful thrust at the Slavophils of the day d at ce made himumerous d irreccilable emies amg them Later after he had lost his post as lecturer however he published by way of revge so to say d to show them what a m they had lost a progressive mthly review which trslated Dicks d advocated the views of George Sd the begng of a very profod vestigati to the causes I believe of the extraordary moralobility of certa ights at a certa epoch or somethg of thatature Some lofty d exceptiallyoble idea was mataed it yway It was said afterwards that the ctuati was hurriedly forbidd d ev that the progressive review had to suffer for havg prted the first part That may very well have be so for what wasot possible those days Though this case it is more likely that there wasothg of the kd d that the author himself was too lazy to cclude his essay He cut short his lectures the Arabs because somehow d by somee probably e of his reactiary emies a letter had be seized givg accot of certa circumstces csequce of which somee had demded explati from him I dt ow whether the story is true but it was asserted that at the same time there was discovered Petersburg a vast natural d illegal cspiracy of thirty people which almost shook society to its fodatis It was said that they were positively the pot of trslatg Fourier As though of desi a poem of Step Trofimovitchs was seized Moscow at that very time though it had be writt six years before Berl his earliest youth d muscript copies had be passed rod a circle csistg of two poetical amateurs d e studt This poem is lygow my table No lger ago th last year I received a rect copy his o hdwritg from Step Trofimovitch himself sied by him d bod a spldid red leather bdg It isot without poetic merit however d ev a certa talt Its strge but those days or to be more exact the thirties people were csttly composg that style I fd it difficult to describe the subject for I really doot derstd it It is some sort of allegory lyrical dramatic form recallg the secd part of Faust The sce ops with a chorus of wom followed by a chorus of m th a chorus of corporeal powers of some sort d at the d of all a chorus of spiritsot yet livg but very eager to come to life All these choruses sg about somethg very defite for the most part about somebodys curse but with a tge of the higher humour But the sce is suddly chged There begs a sort of festival of life at

d m graspg the situati d seizg his place at ce begs aew life withew sight to thgs Well this poem was thought at that time to be dgerous Last year I proposed to Step Trofimovitch to publish it the grod of its perfect harmlesessowadays but he decled the suggesti with evidt dissatisfacti My view of its complete harmlesess evidtly displeased him d I ev ascribe to it a certa coless his part which lasted two whole mths d what do you thk Suddly almost at the time I proposed prtg it here our poem was published abroad a collecti of revolutiary verse without the owledge of Step Trofimovitch He was at first alarmed rushed to the goveor d wrote aoble letter self defce to Petersburg He read it to me twice but didot sd it ot owg to whom to address it fact he was a state of agitati for a whole mth but I am cvced that the secret recesses of his heart he was ormously flattered He almost took the copy of the collecti to bed with him d kept it hidd der his mattress the daytime he positively wouldot allow the wom to tu his bed d although he expected every day a telegram he held his head high No telegram came Th he made frids with me aga which is a proof of the extreme kess of his gtle d restful heart II Of course I dt assert that he hadever suffered for his cvictis at all but I am fully cvced that he might have ge lecturg his Arabs as lg as he liked if he had ly giv theecessary explatis But he was too lofty d he proceeded with peculiar haste to assure himself that his career was rued forever by the vortex of circumstce d if the whole truth is to be told the real cause of the chge his career was the very delicate propositi which had be made before d was th rewed by Varvara Petroa Stavrog a lady of great wealth the wife of a lieutt geral that he should dertake the educati d the whole tellectual developmt of her ly s the capacity of a superior sort of teacher d frid to sayothg of a maifict salary This proposal had be made to him the first time Berl at the momt wh he was first left a widower His first wife was a frivolous girl from our provce whom he married his early d thkg youth d appartly he had had a great deal of trouble with this yog pers charmg as she was owg to the lack of mes for her support d also from other more delicate reass She died Paris after three years separati from him leavg him a s of five years old the fruit of our first joyous d clouded love were the words the sorrowg father ce let fall my presce The child had from the first be st back to Russia where he was brought up the charge of distt couss some remote regi Step Trofimovitch had decled Varvara Petroas proposal that occasi d had quickly married aga before the year was over a tacitu Berl girl d what makes it more strge there waso particularecessity for him to do so But apart from his marriage there were it appears other reass for his declg the situati He was tempted by the resodg fame of a professor celebrated at that time d he his tu hasted to the lecturers chair for which he had be preparg himself to try his eagle wgs flight Butow with sged wgs heaturally remembered the propositi which ev th had made him hesitate The sudd death of his secd wife who didot live a year with him settled the matter decisively To put it plaly it was all brought about by the passiate sympathy d priceless so to speak classic fridship of Varvara Petroa if e may use such expressi of fridship He flg himself to the arms of this fridship d his positi was settled for more th twty years I use the expressi flg himself to the arms of but God forbid that ye should fly to idle d superfluous cclusis These embraces must be derstood ly the most loftily moral sse The most refed d delicate tie ited these two begs both so remarkable forever The post of tutor was the more readily accepted too as the property a very small e left to Step Trofimovitch by his first wife was close to Skvoresiki the Stavrogs maifict estate the outskirts of our provcial to Besides the stiless of his study far from the immse burd of iversity work it was always possible to devote himself to the service of scice d to rich the literature of his cotry with erudite studies These works didot appear But the other hd it did appear possible to spd the rest of his life more th twty years a reproach caate so to speak to hisative cotry the words of a popular poet Reproach caate thou didst std Erect before thy Fatherld O Liberal idealist But the pers to whom the popular poet referred may perhaps have had the right to adopt that pose for the rest of his life if he had wished to do so though it must have be tedious Our Step Trofimovitch was to tell the truth ly imitator compared with such people moreover he had gro weary of stdg erect d oft lay do for a while But to do him justice the caati of reproach was preserved ev the recumbt attitude the more so as that was quite sufficit for the provce You should have se him at our club wh he sat do to cards His whole figure seemed to exclaim Cards Me sit do to whist with you Is it csistt Who is respsible for it Who has shattered my ergies d tued them to whist Ah perish Russia d he would majestically trump with a heart d to tell the truth he dearly loved a game of cards which led him especially later years to frequt d pleast skirmishes with Varvara Petroa particularly as he was always losg But of that later I will ly observe that he was a m of tder cscice that is sometimes d so was oft depressed the course of his twty years fridship with Varvara Petroa he used regularly three or four times a year to sk to a state of patriotic grief as it was called amg us or rather really to attack of sple but our estimable Varvara Petroa preferred the former phrase Of late years his grief had beg to beot ly patriotic but at times alcoholic too but Varvara Petroas aleress succeeded keepg him all his life from trivial clatis d heeeded somee to look after him deed for he sometimes behaved very oddly the midst of his exalted sorrow he would beg laughg like y simple peast There were momts wh he beg to take a humorous te ev about himself But there wasothg Varvara Petroa dreaded so much as a humorous te She was a wom of the classic type a female Mæcas variably guided ly by the highest csideratis The fluce of this exalted lady over her poor frid for twty years is a fact of the first importce I shalleed to speak of her more particularly which Iow proceed to do III There are strge fridships The two frids are always ready to fly at e other d go like that all their lives d yet they cnot separate Partg fact is utterly impossible The e who has beg the quarrel d separated will be the first to fall ill d ev die perhaps if the separati comes off I ow for a positive fact that several times Step Trofimovitch has jumped up from the sofa d beat the wall with his fists after the most timate d emotial tête à tête with Varvara Petroa This proceedg was byo mes empty symbol deed e occasi he broke some plaster off the wall It may be asked how I come to ow such delicate details What if I were myself a wiess of it What if Step Trofimovitch himself has more th e occasi sobbed my shoulder while he described to me lurid colours all his most secret feelgs d what was there he didot say at such times But what almost always happed after these tearful outbreaks was thatext day he was ready to crucify himself for his gratitude He would sd for me a hurry or r over to see me simply to assure me that Varvara Petroa was gel of hour d delicacy while he was very much the opposite He didot ly r to cfide me but more th e occasi described it all to her the most eloqut letter d wrote a full sied cfessi thato lger ago th the day before he had told outsider that she kept him out of vity that she was vious of his talts d eruditi that she hated him d was ly afraid to express her hatred oply dreadg that he would leave her d so damage her literary reputati that this drove him to self ctempt d he was resolved to die a violt death d that he was waitg for the fal word from her which would decide everythg d so d so the same style You c fcy after this what hysterical pitch theervous outbreaks of this most noct of all fifty year old fts sometimes reached I ce read e of these letters after some quarrel betwe them arisg from a trivial matter but growg vomous as it wt I was horrified d besought himot to sd it I must more hourable duty I shall die if I dt cfess everythg everythg he swered almost delirium d he did sd the letter That was the differce betwe them that Varvara Petroaever would have st such a letter It is true that he was passiately fd of writg he wrote to her though he lived the same house d durg hysterical terludes he would write two letters a day I ow for a fact that she always read these letters with the greatest attti ev wh she received two a day d after readg them she put them away a special drawer sorted d notated moreover she pdered them her heart But she kept her frid all day without swer met him as though there wereothg the matter exactly as thoughothg special had happed the day before By degrees she broke him so completely that at last he didot himself dare to allude to what had happed the day before d ly glced to her eyes at times But sheever forgot ythg while he sometimes forgot too quickly d couraged by her composure he wouldot frequtly if frids came laugh d make jokes over the champae the very same day With what malicy she must have looked at him at such momts while heoticedothg Perhaps a weeks time a mths time or ev six mths later chcg to recall some phrase such a letter d th the whole letter with all its attdt circumstces he would suddly grow hot with shame d be so upset that he fell ill with e of his attacks of summer cholera These attacks of a sort of summer cholera were some cases the regular csequce of hiservous agitatis d were terestg peculiarity of his physical cstituti No doubt Varvara Petroa did very oft hate him But there was e thg he hadot disceed up to the d that was that he had become for her a s her creati ev e may say her vti he had become flesh of her flesh d she kept d supported himot simply from vy of his talts d how woded she must have be by such suppositis exhaustible love for him lay ccealed her heart the midst of ctual hatred jealousy d ctempt She wouldot let a speck of dust fall up him coddled him up for twty two years wouldot have slept forights together if

exacted a great deal from him sometimes ev slavisess It was credible how lg she harboured restmt I have two ecdotes to tell about that IV e occasi just at the time wh the first rumours of the emcipati of the serfs were the air wh all Russia was exultg d makg ready for a complete regerati Varvara Petroa was visited by a bar from Petersburg a m of the highest cnectis d very closely associated with theew reform Varvara Petroa prized such visits highly as her cnectis higher circles had gro weaker d weaker sce the death of her husbd d had at last ceased altogether The bar spt hour drkg tea with her There waso e else prest but Step Trofimovitch whom Varvara Petroa vited d exhibited The bar had heard somethg about him before or affected to have de so but paid little attti to him at tea Step Trofimovitch of course was capable of makg a social blder d his mners were most elegt Though I believe he was byo mes of exalted orig yet it happed that he had from earliest childhood be brought up a Moscow household of high rk d csequtly was well bred He spoke Frch like a Parisi Thus the bar was to have se from the first glce the sort of people with whom Varvara Petroa surroded herself ev provcial seclusi But thgs didot fall out like this Wh the bar positively asserted the absolute truth of the rumours of the great reform which were th ly just begng to be heard Step Trofimovitch couldot cta himself d suddly shouted Hurrah d ev made some gesticulati dicative of delight His ejaculati wasot over loud d quite polite his delight was ev perhaps premeditated d his gesture purposely

Varvara Petroa was at first silt for two or three mutes d seemed to be lookg for somethg the table Th she tued to Step Trofimovitch d with pale face d flashg eyes she hissed a whisper I shallever forgive you for that Next day she met her frid as thoughothg had happed sheever referred to the cidt but thirte years afterwards at a tragic momt she recalled it d reproached him with it d she tued pale just as she had de thirte years before ly twice the course of her life did she say to him I shallever forgive you for that The cidt with the bar was the secd time but the first cidt was so characteristic d had so much fluce the fate of Step Trofimovitch that I vture to refer to that too It was sprg time May just after theews had reached Skvoresiki of the death of Lieutt Geral Stavrog a frivolous old gtlem who died of a stomach ailmt the way to the Crimea where he was hastg to jo the army active service Varvara Petroa was left a widow d put deep moug She couldot it is true deplore his death very deeply sce for the last four years she had be completely separated from him owg to compatibility of temper d was givg him allowce The Lieutt Geral himself hadothg but e hdred d fifty serfs d his pay besides his positi d his cnectis All the mey d Skvoresiki belged to Varvara Petroa the ly daughter of a very rich ctractor Yet she was shocked by the suddness of theews d retired to complete solitude Step Trofimovitch of course was always at her side May was its full beauty The evgs were exquisite The wild cherry was flower The two frids walked every evg the gard d used to sit tillightfall the arbour d pour out their thoughts d feelgs to e other They had poetic momts der the fluce of the chge her positi Varvara Petroa talked more th usual She as it were clg to the heart of her frid d this ctued for several evgs A strge idea suddly came over Step Trofimovitch Wasot the csolable widow reckg up him d expectg from him wh her moug was over the offer of his hd A cical idea but the very loftess of a msature sometimes creases a dispositi to cical ideas if ly from the my sideess of his culture He beg to look more deeply to it d thought it seemed like it He pdered Her forte is immse of course but Varvara Petroa certaly couldot be called a beauty She was a tall yellow by wom with extremely lg face suggestive of a horse Step Trofimovitch hesitated more d more he was tortured by doubts he positively shed tears of decisi ce or twice he weptot frequtly the evgs that is to say the arbour his cotce voltarily beg to express somethg capricious d irical somethg

beg workg her heart that could have fully justified Step Trofimovitchs suspicis Moreover she wouldot have chged herame Stavrog for hisame famous as it was Perhaps there wasothg it but the play of femity her side the mifestati of cscious feme yeag soatural some extremely feme types However I wt swer for it the depths of the female heart haveot be explored to this day But I must ctue It is to be supposed that she so wardly guessed the siificce of her frids strge expressi she was quick d observt d he was sometimes extremely guileless But the evgs wt as before d their cversatis were just as poetic d terestg d behold e occasi atightfall after the most lively d poetical cversati they parted affectiately warmly pressg each others hds at the steps of the lodge where Step Trofimovitch slept Every summer he used to move to this little lodge which stood adjog the huge seiorial house of Skvoresiki almost the gard He had ly just ge d restless hesitati tak a cigar dot havg yet lighted it was stdg weary d motiless before the op wdow gazg at the light feathery white clouds glidg arod the bright mo wh suddly a fat rustle made him start d tu rod Varvara Petroa whom he had left ly four mutes earlier was stdg before him aga Her yellow face was almost blue Her lips were pressed tightly together d twitchg at the coers For t full secds she looked him the eyes silce with a firm reltless gaze d suddly whispered rapidly I shallever forgive you for this Wh t years later Step Trofimovitch after closg the doors told me this melcholy tale a whisper he vowed that he had be so petrified the spot that he hadot se or heard how Varvara Petroa had disappeared As sheever ce afterwards alluded to the cidt d everythg wt as thoughothg had happed he was all his life cled to the idea that it was all hallucati a symptom of iless the more so as he was actually tak ill that veryight d was disposed for a foright which by the way cut short the terviews the arbour But spite of his vague theory of hallucati he seemed every day all his life to be expectg the ctuati d so to say the douemt of this affair He couldot believe that that was the d of it d if so he must have looked strgely sometimes at his frid V She had herself desied the costume for him which he wore for the rest of his life It was elegt d characteristic a lg black frock coat butted almost to the top but stylishly cut a soft hat summer a straw hat with a wide brim a white batiste cravat with a full bow d hgg ds a ce with a silver ob his hair flowed to his shoulders It was dark bro d ly lately had beg to get a little grey He was cle shav He was said to have be very hdsome his youth d to my md he was still exceptially impressive figure ev old age Besides who c talk of old age at fifty three From his special pose as a patriot however he didot try to appear yoger but seemed rather to pride himself the solidity of his age d dressed as described tall d th with flowg hair he looked almost like a patriarch or ev more like the portrait of the poet Kukoik graved the editi of his works published or thereabouts This resemblce was especially strikg wh he sat the gard summertime a seat der a bush of flowerg lilac with both hds propped his ce d op book beside him musg poetically over the settg s regard to books I may remark that he came later years rather to avoid readg But that was ly quite towards the d The papers d magazes ordered great profusi by Varvara Petroa he was ctually readg Heever lost terest the successes of Russi literature either though he always mataed a diified attitude with regard to them He was at e time grossed the study of our home d forei politics but he so gave up the dertakg with a gesture of despair It sometimes happed that he would take De Tocqueville with him to the gard while he had a Paul de Kock his pocket But these are trivial matters I must observe parthesis about the portrait of Kukoik the gravg had first come to the hds of Varvara Petroa wh she was a girl a high class boardg school Moscow She fell love with the portrait at ce after the habit of all girls at school who fall love with ythg they come across as well as with their teachers especially the drawg d writg masters What is terestg this though isot the characteristics of girls but the fact that ev at fifty Varvara Petroa kept the gravg amg her most timate d treasured possessis so that perhaps it was ly this accot that she had desied for Step TrofimovitcINTRODUCTION PREFARATORY It was with csiderable reluctce that I abded favour of the prest dertakg what had lg be a favourite project that of aew editi of Shelt’s “D Quixote ” which hasow become a somewhat scarce book There are some—d I cfess myself to be e—for whom Shelt’s racy old versi with all its defects has a charm thato mode trslati however skilful or correct could possess Shelt had the estimable advtage of belgg to the same gerati as Cervtes “D Quixote” had to him a vitality that ly a ctemporary could feel it cost himo dramatic effort to see thgs as Cervtes saw them there iso achrism his lguage he put the Spish of Cervtes to the glish of Shakespeare Shakespeare himself most likely ew the book he may have carried it home with him his saddle bags to Stratford e of his last joueys d der the mulberry tree at New Place joed hds with a kdred gius its pages But it was so made pla to me that to hope for ev a moderate popularity for Shelt was va His fe old crusted glish would o doubt be relished by a mority but it would be ly by a mority His warmest admirers must admit that he isot a satisfactory represtative of Cervtes His trslati of the First Part was very hastily made d wasever revised by him It has all the fresess d vigour but also a full measure of the faults of a hasty producti It is oft very literal—barbarously literal frequtly—but just as oft very loose He had evidtly a good colloquial owledge of Spish but appartlyot much more Itever seems to occur to him that the same trslati of a word willot suit every case It is oft said that we haveo satisfactory trslati of “D Quixote ” To those who are familiar with the origal it savours of truism or platitude to say so for truth there c beo thoroughly satisfactory trslati of “D Quixote” to glish or y other lguage It isot that the Spish idioms are so utterly mageable or that the trslatable words umerous ougho doubt are so superabdt but rather that the sttious tersess to which the humour of the book owes its flavour is peculiar to Spish d c at best be ly disttly imitated y other tgue The history of our glish trslatis of “D Quixote” is structive Shelt’s the first y lguage was made appartly about butot published till This of course was ly the First Part It has be asserted that the Secd published isot the work of Shelt but there isothg to support the asserti save the fact that it has less spirit less of what we gerally derstd by “go ” about it th the first which would be lyatural if the first were the work of a yog m writg currte calamo d the secd that of a middle aged m writg for a bookseller the other hd it is closer d more literal the style is the same the very same trslatis or mistrslatis occur it d it is extremely likely that aew trslator would by suppressg hisame have allowed Shelt to carry off the credit Jo Phillips Milt’sephew produced a “D Quixote” “made glish ” he says “accordg to the humour of our mode lguage ” His “Quixote” isot so much a trslati as a travesty d a travesty that for coarsess vulgarity d buffoery is almost exampled ev the literature of that day Ned Ward’s “Life d Notable Advtures of D Quixote merrily trslated to Hudibrastic Verse” c scarcely be recked a trslati but it serves to show the light which “D Quixote” was regarded at the time A further illustrati may be fod the versi published by Peter Motteux who had th rectly combed tea dealg with literature It is described as “trslated from the origal by several hds ” but if so all Spish flavour has tirely evaporated der the mipulati of the several hds The flavour that it has the other hd is distctly Frco cocey ye who compares it carefully with the origal will have little doubt that it is a ccocti from Shelt d the Frch of Filleau de Sat Mart eked out by borrowgs from Phillips whose mode of treatmt it adopts It is to be sure more dect d decorous but it treats “D Quixote” the same fashi as a comic book that cnot be made too comic To attempt to improve the humour of “D Quixote” by fusi of cocey flippcy d facetiouess as Motteux’s operators did isot merely impertce like lardg a sirlo of prize beef but absolute falsificati of the spirit of the book d it is a proof of the critical way which “D Quixote” is gerally read that this worse th worthless trslati—worthless as failg to represt worse th worthless as misreprestg—should have be favoured as it has be It had the effect however of brgg out a trslati dertak d executed a very differt spirit that of Charles Jervas the portrait pater d frid of Pope Swift Arbutot d Gay Jervas has be allowed little credit for his work deed it may be saide for it is o to the world geral as Jarvis’s It wasot published til after his death d the prters gave theame accordg to the currt prciati of the day It has be the most freely used d the most freely abused of all the trslatis It has se far more editis th y other it is admitted all hds to be by far the most faithful d yetobody seems to have a good word to say for it or for its author Jervaso doubt prejudiced readers agast himself his preface where amg my true words about Shelt Stevs d Motteux he rashly d justly charges Shelt with havg trslatedot from the Spish but from the Itali versi of Frciosi which didot appear til t years after Shelt’s first volume A suspici of competce too seems to have attached to him because he was by professi a pater d a mediocre e though he has giv us the best portrait we have of Swift d this may have be strgthed by Pope’s remark that he “trslated ‘D Quixote’ without derstdg Spish ” He has be also charged with borrowg from Shelt whom he disparaged It is true that a few difficult or obscure passages he has followed Shelt d ge astray with him but for e case of this sort there are fifty where he is right d Shelt wrg As for Pope’s dictum ye who exames Jervas’s versi carefully side by side with the origal will see that he was a sod Spish scholar comparably a better e th Shelt except perhaps mere colloquial Spish He was fact hest faithful d pastakg trslator d he has left a versi which whatever its shortcomgs may be is sgularly free from errors d mistrslatis The charge agast it is that it is stiff dry—“wood” a word —do e c dy that there is a fodati for it But it may be pleaded for Jervas that a good deal of this rigidity is due to his abhorrce of the light flippt jocose style of his predecessors He was e of the few very few trslators that have sho y apprehsi of the smilg gravity which is the essce of Quixotic humour it seemed to him a crime to brg Cervtes forward smirkg d grng at his o good thgs d to this may be attributed a great measure the ascetic abstce from everythg savourg of liveless which is the characteristic of his trslati most mode editis it should be observed his style has be smoothed d smarted but without y referce to the origal Spish so that if he has be made to read more agreeably he has also be robbed of his chief merit of fidelity Smollett’s versi published may be almost coted as e of these At y rate it is pla that its cstructi Jervas’s trslati was very freely dra up d very little or probablyo heed giv to the origal Spish The later trslatis may be dismissed a few words George Kelly’s which appeared “prted for the Trslator ” was impudt imposture begothg more th Motteux’s versi with a few of the words here d there artfully trsposed Charles Wilmot’s was ly abridgmt like Flori’s butot so skilfully executed d the versi published by Miss Smirke to accompy her brother’s plates was merely a patchwork producti made out of former trslatis the latest Mr A J Duffield’s it would be every sse of the word impertt me to offer opi here I hadot ev se it wh the prest dertakg was proposed to me d sce th I may say vidi ttum havg for obvious reass resisted the temptati which Mr Duffield’s reputati d comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervtes From the foregog history of our trslatis of “D Quixote ” it will be se that there are a good my people who provided they get the merearrative with its full complemt of facts cidts d advtures served up to them a form that amuses them care very little whether that form is the e which Cervtes origally shaped his ideas the other hd it is clear that there are my who desire to haveot merely the story he tells but the story as he tells it so far at least as differces of idiom d circumstces permit d who will give a preferce to the cscitious trslator ev though he may have acquitted himself somewhat awkwardly But after all there iso real tagism betwe the two classes there iso reas why what pleases the e shouldot please the other or why a trslator who makes it his aim to treat “D Quixote” with the respect due to a great classic shouldot be as acceptable ev to the careless reader as the e who treats it as a famous old jest book It isot a questi of caviare to the geral or if it is the fault rests with him who makes so The method by which Cervtes w the ear of the Spish people ought mutatis mutdis to be equally effective with the great majority of glish readers At y rate ev if there are readers to whom it is a matter of differce fidelity to the method is as much a part of the trslator’s duty as fidelity to the matter If he c please all parties so much the better but his first duty is to those who look to him for as faithful a represtati of his author as it is his power to give them faithful to the letter so lg as fidelity is practicable faithful to the spirit so far as he c make it My purpose here isot to dogmatise the rules of trslati but to dicate those I have followed or at least tried to the best of my ability to follow the prest stce e which it seems to me cnot be too rigidly followed trslatg “D Quixote ” is to avoid everythg that savours of affectati The book itself is deed e sse a protest agast it do m abhorred it more th Cervtes For this reas I thk y temptati to use tiquated or obsolete lguage should be resisted It is after all affectati d e for which there iso warrt or excuse Spish has probably derge less chge sce the sevteth ctury th y lguage Europe d by far the greater d certaly the best part of “D Quixote” differs but little lguage from the colloquial Spish of the prest day Except the tales d D Quixote’s speeches the trslator who uses the simplest d plaest everyday lguage will almost always be the e who approachesearest to the origal Seeg that the story of “D Quixote” d all its characters d cidts haveow be for more th two cturies d a half familiar as household words glish mouths it seems to me that the old familiarames d phrases shouldot be chged without good reas Of course a trslator who holds that “D Quixote” should receive the treatmt a great classic deserves will feel himself bod by the jcti laid up the Morisco Chap IXot to omit or add ythg CERVANTES Four geratis had laughed over “D Quixote” before it occurred to ye to ask who d what mner of m was this Miguel de Cervtes Saavedra whoseame is the title page d it was too late for a satisfactory swer to the questi wh it was proposed to add a life of the author to the Ld editi published at Lord Carteret’s stce All traces of the persality of Cervtes had by that time disappeared y floatg traditis that may ce have existed trsmitted from m who had o him had lg sce died out d of other record there wase for the sixteth d sevteth cturies were curious as to “the m of the time ” a reproach agast which theeteth has at y rate secured itself if it has producedo Shakespeare or Cervtes All that Mays y Siscar to whom the task was trusted or y of those who followed him Rios Pellicer or Navarrete could do was to eke out the few allusis Cervtes makes to himself his various prefaces with such pieces of documtary evidce bearg up his life as they could fd This however has be de by the lastamed biographer to such good purpose that he has superseded all predecessors Thorougess is the chief characteristic of Navarrete’s work Besides siftg testg d methodisg with rare patice d judgmt what had be previously brought to light he left as the sayg is o ste tued der which ythg to illustrate his subject might possibly be fod Navarrete has de all that dustry d acum could do d it iso fault of his if he hasot giv us what we wt What Hallam says of Shakespeare may be applied to the almost parallel case of Cervtes “It isot the register of his baptism or the draft of his will or the orthography of hisame that we seek o letter of his writg o record of his cversati o character of him dra by a ctemporary has be produced ” It is lyatural therefore that the biographers of Cervtes forced to make brick without straw should have recourse largely to cjecture d that cjecture should some stces come by degrees to take the place of established fact All that I propose to do here is to separate what is matter of fact from what is matter of cjecture d leave it to the reader’s judgmt to decide whether the data justify the ferce orot The m

Theew Spa was the mightiest power the world had se sce the Rom Empire d it hadot yet be called up to pay the price of its greaess By the policy of Ferdd d Ximez the soverei had be made absolute d the Church d quisiti adroitly adjusted to keep him so Theobles who had always resisted absolutism as struously as they had fought the Moors had be divested of all political power a like fate had befall

a set off agast this the old historical d traditial ballads d the true pastorals the sgs d ballads of peast life were beg collected assiduously d prted the ccieros that succeeded e other with creasg rapidity But the mostotable csequce perhaps of the spread of prtg was the flood of romces of chivalry that had ctued to pour from the press ever sce Garci Ordoñez de Mtalvo had resuscitated “Amadis of Gaul” at the begng of the ctury For a youth fd of readg solid or light there could have beo better spot Spa th Alcalá de Hares the middle of the sixteth ctury It was th a busy populous iversity to

have be the strg pots of the iversity but the to itself seems to have cled rather to the humities d light literature d as a producer of books Alcalá was already begng to compete with the older presses of Toledo Burgos Salamca d Seville A pdt to the picture Cervtes has giv us of his first playgogs might o doubt have be oft se the streets of Alcalá at that time a bright eager tay haired boy peerg to a book shop where the latest volumes lay op to tempt the public wderg it may be what that little book with the woodcut of the bld beggar d his boy that called itself “Vida de Lazarillo de Tormes segda impresi ” could be about or with eyes brimmg over with merrimt gazg at e of those preposterous portraits of a ight errt outrageous poply d plumes with which the publishers of chivalry romces loved to embellish the title pages of their folios If the boy was the father of the m the sse of the cgruous that was strg at fifty was lively at t d some such reflectis as these may have be the true gesis of “D Quixote ” For his more solid educati we are told he wt to Salamca But why Rodrigo de Cervtes who was very poor should have st his s to a iversity a hdred d fifty miles away wh he had e at his o door would be a puzzle if we had y reas for supposg that he did so The ly evidce is a vague statemt by Professor Tomas Gzalez that he ce saw old try of the matriculati of a Miguel de Cervtes This doesot appear to have be ever se aga but ev if it had d if the date correspded it would proveothg as there were at least two other Miguels bo about the middle of the ctury e of them moreover a Cervtes

positively about his educati is that Ju Lopez de Hoyos a professor of humities d belles lettres of some emce calls him his “dear d beloved pupil ” This was a little collecti of verses by differt hds the death of Isabel de Valois secd que of Philip II published by the professor to which Cervtes ctributed four pieces cludg elegy d epitaph the form of a snet It is ly by a rare chce that a “Lycidas”

made by Mr Le from time to time sce its first publicati These however from the accuracy with which the trslati was made d the fuess of the Notes areot veryumerous The same reass have also caused my

delay which this process has occasied the prtg of the work I have called this a complete editi to distguish it from two others which have be published without Mr Lesotes or his method of writg orital

complete views of the several subjects which might with propriety be fully discussed at the head of my trslati d I thk it better therefore to appd at the close of the work my observatis which I

the commcemt of the work d addg y matter of my o The object with which the trslati was made is best expressed the words of Mr Les preface My dertakg to trslate ew the Tales of The Thousd d e Nights implies favourable opi of the versi which has so lg amused us but I must express my objectis with respect to the latter pla terms d this I shall do by mes of a few words the versi of Galld from which it is derived for to him ale its chief faults are to be attributed I am somewhat reluctt to make this remark because several perss d amg them some of high d deserved reputati as Arabic scholars have proced opi that his versi is improvemt up the origal That The Thousd d e Nights may be greatly improved I most readily admit but as cfidtly do I assert that Galld has excessively perverted the work His acquatce with Arab mners d customs was sufficit to preserve him always from errors of the grossest descripti d by the style of his versi he has giv to the whole a false character thus sacrificg a great measure what is most valuable the origal work I me its mute accuracy with respect to those peculiarities which distguish the Arabs from every otherati ot ly of the West but also of the East

Osmlee Turks later days have but little altered Cairo is the city which Arabi mnersow exist the most refed state d such I believe to have be the case wh the prest work was composed Mr Les first two

Khaleefeh Háro Er Rasheed is troduced the best with few exceptis the collecti are Egypti character But sce the Mode Egyptis were described by Mr Le all thgs the East have chged d every day wiesses the

it right to omit such tales ecdotes c as are comparatively terestg or y accot objectiable other words I sertothg that I deem greatly ferior terest to the tales the old versi Certa passages which the

them gerally tolerable to the reader but afterwards I reflected that the character of the work would be thus greatly altered d its value as illustratg Arab mners d feelgs much dimished I therefore determed to preserve a csiderableumber of select pieces chos either for their relative merits or because required by the ctext Theumber of those comprised the first volume of my trslati isearly half

the followg mog mamma accompied her to what was csidered our schoolroom d said “Now my dears I place you der Miss Evel’s care you must obey her all thgs she will teach you your lesss as I am able to

wh they deserve whippg you will seriously offd me ” As mamma said this I observed Miss Evel’s eyes appeared to dilate with a sort of joy d I felt certa that severely as mamma had oft whipped us if we shouldow deserve it Miss Evel would admister it much more severely She looked amiability itself d was truly beautiful face d pers twty two years of age full d fely formed d dressed always with the most studiedeaess She was truth a seductive creature She made stteous impressi my sses There was however somewhat of a steness of expressi d a diity of carriage which caused at ce to fear d respect her Of course at first all wt smoothly ough d seeg that mamma treated me precisely as she did my sisters I came to be regarded as quite a child by Miss Evel She fod that she had to sleep the same room with my sisters d myself I fcied that the firstight Miss Evel didot approve of this arrgemt but gradually became familiarized with it d seemed to thko more about it Wh bedtime came we all kissed mamma d retired early as usual Miss Evel followed some hours later Wh she came she carefully locked the door th looked at me to see if I was asleep Why I owot but I was stctively prompted to fei sleep I did so successfully otwithstdg the passg of the cdle before my eyes So she at ce commced dressg Wh her back was tued I oped my eyes d greedily devoured heraked charms as they were gradually exhibited before me The momt she tued rod I was aga as if asleep I have said that my passis had beg to develop themselves but as yet I didot derstd their force or directi I well remember this firstight wh a fe ripe wom gradually removed every particle of dress with a couple of yards of me—the effect of each succeedg charm from her lovely d beautifully formed bubbies to the takg off her shoes d stockgs from her well formed legs d small feet d kles caused my prick to swell d stiff to a paful extt Wh all but her chemise was removed she stopped to pick up her petticoats that she had allowed to fall to her feet d liftg them raised also her chemise d exposed to my view a most glorious bottom—dazzlgly white d shg like sat As the light was full up it d she was still a stoopg positi I could see that below her slit she was well covered with dark hair Tug rod to put her petticoats a chair d to take up herightgo she slipped her chemise from her arm d lettg it fall to the grod while she lifted theightgo over her head I had for some secds a view of her beautiful belly thickly covered with dark curly hair over the mot of Vus So voluptuous was the sight I almost shuddered so tse was my excitemt Sheow sat do the bed to take off her shoes d stockgs Oh what beautiful thighs legs kles d feet she had I amow advced life d have had my hdsome d well formed wom but Iever saw limbs more voluptuously formed a few mutes the light was extguished d a rushg rill flowed to theight vase very differt from the gtle tricklgs from myself d sisters as we oft squatted do opposite each other d crossed water laughg at the differt sources from which they flowed My sisters oft vied me the power of directg the spurt where I pleased so little were we from dreamg of the real tt of that projectg little strumt I heard the

be observt of her dressg Wh at last I dozed off it was but to dream of all the charms I had se About a mth passed thus Everyight Miss Evel became more d more at her ease d cfidt of my mere childisess oft gave me glorious d lgthed glimpses of her beautifully developed charms although it was ly about every otheright that I could joy them for as they always produced sleeplesess afterwards the followgightature assured her rights d I usually slept profodly wh I would have preferred ctued gazg the charms of my lovely goveess But doubtless those exhaustg sleeps helped to throw her off her guard d gave me better opportities th I should otherwise have had ce or twice she used theight ware before puttg herightgo d I could see the rosy lipped opg embosomed exquisite dark curls pourg out its full measure of water showg a fe force ofature d drivg me wild with excitemt Yet it is sgular that Iever ce thought of applyg to my fgers for relief from the paful stifess thatearly burst my prick asder Whether mamma had observed my very frequt projecti of my trousers or beg to thk it better I shouldot sleep the same room as Miss Evel I cnot say but she had my bed removed to her o However I was so thoroughly treated as a mere boy by everye the house that Miss Evel seemed to forget my sex d there was at all times a freedom of carriage d abd her attitudes that she certaly wouldot have dulged if she had felt y restrat from csiderg herself the presce of a youth of the age of puberty cold weather I used to sit a low stool by the fire—Miss Evel was seated frt I had my less book my ee d she herself would place her beautiful feet the high school fder with her work her lap while she heard my sisters repeat their less totally cscious that for half hour at a time she was exposg her beautiful legs d thighs to my ardt gaze for sittg much below her d bdg my head as if tt my less my eyes were below her raised petticoats Her close d tight fittg white stockgs displayed her well formed legs for while cfed to the house durg our mog lesss she didot wear drawers so that the positi she sat with her ees higher th her feet the already high fder d her legs somewhat apart to hold her work her lap more easily the whole glorious derswell of both thighs d the lower part of her fe large bottom with the pky slit quite visible estled a rich profusi of dark curls were fully exposed to my view The light from the fire glcg der her raised petticoats tged the whole with a glow d set me equally a blaze of desire til I was almost ready to fat I could have rushed headlg der her petticoats d kissed d fdled that delicious opg d all its surrodgs Oh how little she thought of the passi she was raisg Oh dear Miss Evel how I did love you from the daty kid slipper d tight glossy silk stockg up to the glorious swell of the beautiful bubbies that were so fully exposed to meearly everyight d the lovely lips of all that I lged to lovgly embrace Thus day after day passed away d Miss Evel became to me a goddess a creature whom my heart of hearts I literally worshiped Wh she left the schoolroom d I was ale I kissed that part of the fder her feet had pressed d the seat which she sat d ev the air ch above imagati placg there her lovely ct I craved for somethg beyd this without owg exactly what I wted for as yet I really was utterly iort of ythg appertag to the cjcti of the sexes e day I had ge up

Theext momt Miss Evel herself tered d locked the door It was about hour before dner Takg off her dress d hgg it the wardrobe she drew out a piece of fuiture which had be bought for her the use of which had oft puzzled me she took off the lid poured water to its bas d placed a spgeear it She th took off her go drew her petticoats d chemise up to her waist d fasted them there straddled across it d seated herself up it I thus had the toxicatg delight of gazg all her beautiful charms for wh she tucked up her clothes she stood before her glass prestg to my devourg glce her glorious white bottom all its fuless tug to approach the bidet she equally exposed her lower belly d beautiful mot with all its wealth of hair While straddlg over the bidet before she sat do the whole of her pky lipped ct broke my raptured sight Never shall I forget the wild excitemt of the momt It was almost too much for my excited sses fortately wh seated the immediate cause of my almost maess vished She spged herself well betwe the thighs for about five mutes She th raised herself off the bidet d for a momt aga displayed the poutg lips of her ct—th stood frtg me for two or three mutes while she removed with the rsed spge the tricklg drops of water which still gathered the rich bush of curls arod her quim Thus her belly mot d thighs whose massy fleshed d most voluptuous shape were more fully se by me th they had heretofore be d it may easily be cceived to what a state such a deliberate view threw me Oh Miss Evel dear delicious Miss Evel what would you have thought had you o that I was gazg all your gelic charms d that my eager eyes had be strag themselves to petrate the ricess of those charmg poutg lips which lay so ugly that rich mass of dark curlg hair Oh how I do lg to kiss them for at that time I hado other idea of embracg d still less of petratg them Wh her ablutis were completed she sat do d drew off her stockgs displayg her beautiful white calves d charmg little feet I believe it was this first admirati of really exquisitely formed legs kles d feet which were extraordarily perfect make that first awaked my passi for those objects which have sce always exercised a peculiar charm over me She was also so particularlyeat her shoes—little dark es—that were bijoux to look at I oft took them up d kissed them wh left the room Th her silk stockgs always dra up tight d fittg like a glove set off to the greatest advtage the remarkable fe shape of her legs Puttg silk for cott stockgs she took do a low bodiced dress fished her toilet d left the room I crawled out from der the bed washed my face d hds the water of the bidet d ev drk some my excitemt Some six weeks hadow elapsed sce the arrival of Miss Evel The passi that had seized me for her had so far kept me most obedit to her slightest commd or ev wish d from the same cause atttive to my lesss whot distracted by the circumstces already detailed My example had also had the effect of keepg my sisters much the same groove but it was impossible this could last—it wasotature As lg as all wt smoothly Miss Evel seemed to be all amiability We fcied we could do as we liked d we grew more careless Miss Evel became more reserved d cautied us at first d th threated us with the rod We didot thk she would make use of it Mary grew impertt d e afteo tued sulky over her lesss d set our teacher at defice Miss Evel who had be growg more d more gry had her rise from her seat She obeyed with impudt leer Seizg her by the arm Miss Evel dragged the strugglg girl to the horse My sister was strg d fought hard usg both teeth dails but it was too purpose The ger of our goveess was fully roused d raisg her her arms she carried her forcibly to the horse placed her it held her firmly with e hd while she put theoose rod her with the other which wh dra secured her body otherooses secured each kle to rgs the floor keepg her legs apart by the projecti of the horse d also forcg the ees to bd a little by which the most complete exposure of the bottom d fact of all her private parts too was obtaed Miss Evel th left her d wt to mamma for a rod a few mutes she retued evidtly flushed with passi d proceded to tie Mary’s petticoats well up to her waist leavg her bottom d her pky slit quite bare d exposed directly before my eyes It was quite two mths sce I had se her private parts d I was well surprised to observe the lips more poutg d swelled out as well as the symptoms of a mossy coverg of the mot much more developed deed it was itself more excitg th I had expected for my thoughts had so lg dwelt ly the riper beauties of Miss Evel that I had quite ceased to have y toyg with Mary This full view of all her private parts reawaked former ssatis d strgthed them Miss Evel first removed her o scarf layg bare her plump ivory shoulders d showg the upper halves of her beautiful bubbies which were heavg with the excitemt of her ger She bared her fe right arm d graspg the rod stepped back d raised her arm her eyes glisted a peculiar way She was deed beautiful to see I shallever forget that momt—it was but a momt The rod whistled through the air d fell with a cruel cut poor Mary’s plump little bottom The flesh quivered aga d Mary who had resolvedot to cry flushed her face d bit the damask with which the horse was covered Aga the arm was raised d aga with a sharp whistle it fell the palpatg buttocks below it Still her stubbo temper bore her up d although we saw how she wced ot a sod escaped her lips Drawg back a step Miss Evel aga raised her hd d arm d this time her aim was so true that the lger pots of the rod doubled betwe the buttocks d cctrated themselves betwe the lips of Mary’s privates So agisg was the pa that she screamed out dreadfully Aga the rod fell precisely the same spot “Oh oh oh Dear Miss Evel I willever o ever do so aga ” Her shrieks were ofo avail Cut succeeded cut yell succeeded yell—til the rod was wo to a stump d poor Mary’s bottom was e mass of weals d red as raw beef It was fearful to see d yet such is ourature that to see it was at the same time excitg I couldot keep my eyes from her poutg quim the swellg lips of which der the severity of the pishmt it was dergog ot ly seemed to thick but actually oped d shut d evidtly throbbed with agy But all this was highly excitg for me to wiess I th d there resolved to have a closer specti at a more cvit opportity which didot fail me the d Mewhile her spirit was completely cowed or rather crushed deed we were all fully frighted dow ew what we had to expect if we didot behave ourselves There wasowo fear of y mifestati of temper d we felt we must deed obey implicitly whatever our goveess chose to order We stctively leaed to fear her A very few days after this memorable whippg some visitors arrived—a gtlem d lady The gtlem was old frid of mamma’s who had lately married d mamma had asked them to visit her their weddg tour d spt a short time with us The gtlem was a fe lookg m tall d powerfully built the lady rather delicate lookg but well shaped with good breasts d shoulders small waist d spreadg haches well formed arms small hds d feet d very brillit eyes I thk it was about three days after their arrival that e afteo I wt to the spare room which was occupied by these visitors while there I heard them comg upstairs The lady tered first d I had just time to slip to a closet d draw the door to it wasot quite closed butearly so a mute the gtlem followed d gtly shuttg the door locked it Mrs Bs smiled d said— “Well my love you are a sad teaser you let me haveo rest Surely you had ough lastight d this mog without wtg it aga so so ” “deed I hadot ” he said “Iever c have ough of your delicious pers So come we mustot be lg about it or our absce will be observed ” He seized her rod the waist d drew her lips to his d gave her a lg lg kiss squeezg her to him d movg himself agast her Th seatg himself he pulled her his ee d thrust his hd up her petticoats their mouths beg glued together for some time “We must be quick dear ” she murmured He got up d lifted her the edge of the bed threw her back d takg her legs der his arms exposed everythg to my view She hadot so much hair her mot of Vus as Miss Evel but her slit showed more poutg lips d appeared more op Judge of my excitemt wh I saw Mr Bs butt his trousers d pull out immse cock Oh dear how large it looked it almost frighted me With his fgers he placed the head betwe the lips of Mrs Bs’s sheath d th lettg go his hold d placg both arms so as to support her legs he pushed it all right to her to the hilt at ce I was thderstruck that Mrs Bs didot shriek with agy it did seem such a large thg to thrust right to her belly However far from screamg with pa she appeared to joy it Her eyes glisted her face flushed d she smiled most graciously Mr B The two appeared very happy His large cock slipped d out quite smoothly d his hds pressed the large glossy buttocks d pulled them to him at each home thrust This lastedearly five mutes wh all at ce Mr B stopped short d th followed e or two cvulsive shoves—he grng a very absurd way at her He remaed quiet for a few mutes d th drew out his cock all soft with slimy drops fallg from it to the carpet Takg a towel he wiped up the carpet d wrappg it rod his cock wt to the bas d washed it Mrs Bs lay for a few mutes lger all exposed her quim more op th before d I could see a white slime oozg from it You c hardly image the wild excitemt this sce occasied me First the grd mystery was at ce explaed to me d my iort lggsow ew to what they tded After givg me plty of time to realise all the beauties of her private parts she slipped do the floor adjusted her petticoats d smoothed the disordered coterpe d th wt to the glass to arrge her hair This de she quietly locked the door d Mr Bs wt out The door was th relocked d Mrs B wt to the bas emptied d filled it th raised up her petticoats d bathed the parts betwe her legs with a spge d th rubbed all dry with a towel all this time exposg everythg to my ardt gaze But horror of horrors she after this came straight to the closet d gave a slight scream discoverg me there I blushed up to the ears d tried to stammer out excuse She stared at me at first silt amazemt but at last said— “How came you here sir tell me ” “I was here wh you came up I wted my football which was this closet d wh I heard you comg I hid myself I d’t ow why ” For some mutes she seemed to csider d exame me atttively She th said— “C you be discreet ” “Oh yes ma’am ” “You willever tell ye what you have se ” “No ma’am ” “Well keep this promise d I shall try what I c do to reward you Now go dostairs ” I wt to the schoolroom but I was greatly agitated I scarcely ew what I was dog The sce I had wiessed had complete possessi of my thoughts years but a boy the mysteryow practically explaed to me had awaked all the passis of a m stead of studyg my lesss my thoughts wdered to Mrs B thro back the bed with her fe legs d thighs fully exposed above all the sight of the pky gash with its fleecy hair at the bottom of her belly which I had se for some mutes all op d oozg out the slimy juice that followed the amorous coter they had be dulgg It seemed so much more developed th Miss Evel’s I felt sure that Miss Evel couldever take such a thick lg thg as Mr B had thrust to his wife d yet it appeared to go so easily d moved about so smoothly d so evidtly to the satisfacti d utmost delight of both as was proved by their ardt embracgs fd murmurs d voluptuous movemts especially just before they both ceased together all movemt whatever Th I thought how delicious it would be to treat Miss Evel the same way d to revel with my stiff stdg prick her delicious quim which my md’s eye I saw before me as I had viewed it her risg from the bidet wh I lay hid der the bed

of them There areearer approaches to mode metaphysics the Philebus d the Sophist the Politicus or Statesm is more ideal the form d stitutis of the State are more clearly dra out the Laws as works of art the Symposium d the Protagoras are of higher excellce Buto other Dialogue of Plato has the same largess of view d the same perfecti of style o other shows equal owledge of the world or ctas more of those thoughts which areew as well as old dot of e age ly but of all Nowhere Plato is there a deeper iry or a greater wealth of humour or imagery or more dramatic power Nor y other of his writgs is the attempt made to terweave life d speculati or to cnect politics with philosophy The Republic is the ctre arod which the other Dialogues may be grouped here philosophy reaches the highest pot cp especially Books V VI VII to which cit thkers ever attaed Plato amg the Greeks like Bac amg the modes was the first who cceived a method of owledge althougheither of them always distguished the bare outle or form from the substce of truth d both of them had to be ctt with abstracti of scice which wasot yet realized He was the greatest metaphysical gius whom the world has se d him more th y other cit thker the germs of future owledge are ctaed The scices of logic d psychology which have supplied so my strumts of thought to after ages are based up the alyses of Socrates d Plato The prciples of defiti the law of ctradicti the fallacy of argug a circle the distcti betwe the essce d accidts of a thg oroti betwe mes d ds betwe causes d cditis also the divisi of the md to the ratial ccupisct d irascible elemts or of pleasures d desires toecessary d necessary—these d other great forms of thought are all of them to be fod the Republic d were probably first vted by Plato The greatest of all logical truths d the e of which writers philosophy are most apt to lose sight the differce betwe words d thgs has be most struously sisted by him cp Rep Polit Cratyl ff although he hasot always avoided the cfusi of them his o writgs e g Rep But he doesot bd up truth logical formulae —logic is still veiled metaphysics d the scice which he images to ‘ctemplate all truth d all existce’ is very like the doctre of the syllogism which Aristotle claims to have discovered Soph Elchi Neither must we forget that the Republic is but the third part of a still larger desi which was to have cluded ideal history of Aths as well as a political d physical philosophy The fragmt of the Critias has giv birth to a world famous ficti secd ly importce to the tale of Troy d the legd of Arthur d is said as a fact to have spired some of the earlyavigators of the sixteth ctury This mythical tale of which the subject was a history of the wars of the Athis agast the Isld of Atltis is supposed to be foded up fished poem of Sol to which it would have stood the same relati as the writgs of the logographers to the poems of Homer It would have told of a struggle for Liberty cp Tim C tded to represt the cflict of Persia d Hellas We may judge from theoble commcemt of the Timaeus from the fragmt of the Critias itself d from the third book of the Laws what mner Plato would have treated this high argumt We c ly guess why the great desi was abded perhaps because Plato became ssible of some cgruity a fictitious history or because he had lost his terest it or because advcg years forbade the completi of it d we may please ourselves with the fcy that had this imagaryarrative ever be fished we should have fod Plato himself sympathisg with the struggle for Hellic depdce cp Laws iii ff sgg a hy of triumph over Marath d Salamis perhaps makg the reflecti of Herodotus v where he ctemplates the growth of the Athi empire—‘How brave a thg is freedom of speech which has made the Athis so far exceed every other state of Hellas greaess ’ or more probably attributg the victory to the cit good order of Aths d to the favor of Apollo d Athe cp trod to Critias Aga Plato may be regarded as the ‘capta’ ‘arhchegoz’ or leader of a goodly bd of followers for the Republic is to be fod the origal of Cicero’s De Republica of St Auguste’s City of God of the Utopia of Sir Thomas More d of theumerous other imagary States which are framed up the same model The extt to which Aristotle or the Aristoteli school were debted to him the Politics has be little recoised d the recoiti is the moreecessary because it isot made by Aristotle himself The two philosophers had more comm th they were cscious of d probably some elemts of Plato rema still detected Aristotle glish philosophy too my affities may be traced ot ly the works of the Cambridge Platists but great origal writers like Berkeley or Coleridge to Plato d his ideas That there is a truth higher th experice of which the md bears wiess to herself is a cvicti which our o gerati has be thusiastically asserted d is perhaps gag grod Of the Greek authors who at the Raissce brought aew life to the world Plato has had the greatest fluce The Republic of Plato is also the first treatise up educati of which the writgs of Milt d Locke Rousseau Je Paul d Goethe are the legitimate descdts Like Dte or By he has a revelati of other life like Bac

such as the ity of owledge the rei of law d the equality of the sexes have be ticipated a dream by him The argumt of the Republic is the search after Justice theature of which is first hted at by Cephalus the just d blameless old m—th discussed the basis of proverbial morality by Socrates d Polemarchus—th caricatured by Thrasymachus d partially explaed by Socrates—reduced to abstracti by Glauc d Adeimtus d havg become visible the dividual reappears at lgth the ideal State which is cstructed by Socrates The first care of the rulers is to be educati of which outle is dra after the old Hellic model providg ly for improved religi d morality d more simplicity music d gyastic a mlier stra of poetry d greater harmy of the dividual d the State We are thus led to the ccepti of a higher State

bishmt alg with them d the idea of the State is supplemted by the revelati of a future life The divisi to books like all similar divisis Cp Sir G C Lewis the Classical Museum vol ii p is probably later th the age of Plato Theatural divisis are five umber — Book I d the first half of Book II do to the paragraph begng ‘I had always admired the gius of Glauc d Adeimtus ’ which is troductory the first book ctag a refutati of the popular d sophisticalotis of justice d ccludg like some of the earlier Dialogues without arrivg at y defite result To this is appded a restatemt of theature of justice accordg to comm opi d swer is demded to the questi—What is justice stripped of appearces The secd divisi cludes the remader of the secd d the whole of the third d fourth books which are maly occupied with the cstructi of the first State d the first educati The third divisi csists of the fifth sixth d sevth books which philosophy rather th justice is the subject of quiry d the secd State is cstructed prciples of commism d ruled by philosophers d the ctemplati of the idea of good takes the place of the social d political virtues the eighth dth books the perversis of States d of the dividuals who correspd to them are reviewed successi d theature of pleasure d the prciple of tyrny are further alysed the dividual m The tth book is the cclusi of the whole which the relatis of philosophy to poetry are fally determed d the happess of the citizs this life which hasow be assured is croed by the visi of other Or a more geral divisi to two parts may be adopted the first Books I IV ctag the descripti of a State framed gerally accordce with Hellicotis of religi d morality while the secd Books V X the Hellic State is trsformed to ideal kgdom of philosophy of which all other govemts are the perversis These two pots of view are really opposed d the oppositi is ly veiled by the gius of Plato The Republic like the Phaedrus see troducti to Phaedrus is imperfect whole the higher light of philosophy breaks through the regularity of the Hellic temple which at last fades away to the heavs Whether this imperfecti of structure arises from largemt of the pl or from the imperfect reccilemt the writer’s o md of the strugglg elemts of thought which areow first brought together by him or perhaps from the compositi of the work at differt times—are questis like the similar questi about the Iliad d the Odyssey which are worth askg but which cnot have a distct swer the age of Plato there waso regular mode of publicati d author would have the less scruple alterg or addg to a work which was o ly to a few of his frids There iso absurdity supposg that he may have laid his labours aside for a time or tued from e work to other d such terruptis would be more likely to occur the case of a lg th of a short writg all attempts to determe the chrological order of the Platic writgs teal evidce this certaty about y sgle Dialogue beg composed at e time is a disturbg elemt which must be admitted to affect lger works such as the Republic d the Laws more th shorter es But the other hd the seemg discrepcies of the Republic may ly arise out of the discordt elemts which the philosopher has attempted to ite a sgle whole perhaps without beg himself able to recoise the csistcy which is obvious to us For there is a judgmt of after ages which few great writers have ever be able to ticipate for themselves They doot perceive the wt of cnexi their o writgs or the gaps their systems which are visible ough to those who come after them the begngs of literature d philosophy amid the first efforts of thought d lguage more csistcies occur thow wh the paths of speculati are well wo d the meg of words precisely defed For csistcy too is the growth of time d some of the greatest creatis of the hum md have be wtg ity Tried by this test several of the Platic Dialogues accordg to our mode ideas appear to be defective but the deficicy iso proof that they were composed at differt times or by differt hds d the suppositi that the Republic was writt terruptedly d by a ctuous effort is some degree cfirmed by theumerous referces from e part of the work to other The secd title ‘Cceg Justice ’ isot the e by which the Republic is quoted either by Aristotle or gerally tiquity d like the other secd titles of the Platic Dialogues may therefore be assumed to be of later date Morgste d others have asked whether the defiti of justice which is the professed aim or the cstructi of the State is the prcipal argumt of the work The swer is that the two bld e d are two faces of the same truth for justice is the order of the State d the State is the visible embodimt of justice der the cditis of hum society The e is the soul d the other is the body d the Greek ideal of the State as of the dividual is a fair md a fair body Hegeli phraseology the state is the reality of which justice is the idea Or described Christi lguage the kgdom of God is with d yet developes to a Church or exteal kgdom ‘the houseot made with hds eteal the heavs ’ is reduced to the proportis of earthly buildg Or to use a Platic image justice d the State are the warp d the woof which r through the whole texture d wh the cstituti of the State is completed the ccepti of justice isot dismissed but reappears der the same or differtames throughout the work both as the ner law of the dividual soul d fally as the prciple of rewards d pishmts other life The virtues are based justice of which comm hesty buyg d sellg is the shadow d justice is based the idea of good which is the harmy of the world d is reflected both the stitutis of states d motis of the heavly bodies cp Tim The Timaeus which takes up the political rather th the ethical side of the Republic d is chiefly occupied with hypotheses cceg the outward world yet ctas my dicatis that the same law is supposed to rei over the State overature d over m Too much however has be made of this questi both cit d mode times There is a stage of criticism which all works whether ofature or of art are referred to desi Now cit writgs d deed literature gerally there remas oft a large elemt which wasot comprehded the origal desi For the pl grows der the author’s hd ew thoughts occur to him the act of writg he hasot worked out the argumt to the d before he begs The reader who seeks to fd some e idea der which the whole may be cceived mustecessarily seize the vaguest d most geral Thus Stallbaum who is dissatisfied with the ordary explatis of the argumt of the Republic images himself to have fod the true argumt ‘ the represtati of hum life a State perfected by justice d goveed accordg to the idea of good ’ There may be some use such geral descriptis but they c hardly be said to express the desi of the writer The truth is that we may as well speak of my desis as of e oreed ythg be excluded from the pl of a great work to which the md isaturally led by the associati of ideas d which doesot terfere with the geral purpose What kd or degree of ity is to be sought after a buildg the plastic arts poetry prose is a problem which has to be determed relatively to the subject matter To Plato himself the quiry ‘what was the tti of the writer ’ or ‘what was the prcipal argumt of the Republic’ would have be hardly telligible d therefore had better be at ce dismissed cp the troducti to the Phaedrus Isot the Republic the vehicle of three or four great truths which to Plato’s o md are mostaturally represted the form of the State Just as the Jewish prophets the rei of Messiah or ‘the day of the Lord ’ or the sufferg Servt or people of God or the ‘S of righteouess with healg his wgs’ ly cvey to us at least their great spiritual ideals so through the Greek State Plato reveals to us his o thoughts about dive perfecti which is the idea of good—like the s the visible world —about hum perfecti which is justice—about educati begng youth d ctug later years—about poets d sophists d tyrts who are the false teachers d evil rulers of mkd—about ‘the world’ which is the embodimt of them—about a kgdom which existsowhere up earth but is laid up heav to be the patte d rule of hum life No such spired creati is at ity with itself y more th the clouds of heav wh the s pierces through them Every shade of light d dark of truth d of ficti which is the veil of truth is allowable a work of philosophical imagati It isot all the same ple it easily passes from ideas to myths d fcies from facts to figures of speech It isot prose but poetry at least a great part of it d oughtot to be judged by the rules of logic or the probabilities of history The writer isot fashig his ideas to artistic whole they take possessi of him d are too much for him We haveoeed therefore to discuss whether a State such as Plato has cceived is practicable orot or whether the outward form or the ward life came first to the md of the writer For the practicability of his ideas hasothg to do with their truth d the highest thoughts to which he attas may be truly said to bear the greatest ‘marks of desi’—justice more th the exteal frame work of the State the idea of good more th justice The great scice of dialectic or the orgisati of ideas haso real ctt but is ly a type of the method or spirit which the higher owledge is to be pursued by the spectator of all time d all existce It is the fifth sixth d sevth books that Plato reaches the ‘summit of speculati ’ d these although they fail to satisfy the requiremts of a mode thker may therefore be regarded as the most importt as they are also the most origal portis of the work It isotecessary to discuss at lgth a mor questi which has be raised by Boeckh respectg the imagary date at which the cversati was held the year B C which is proposed by him will do as well as y other for a writer of ficti d especially a writer who like Plato isotoriously careless of chrology cp Rep Symp A etc ly aims at geral probability Whether all the perss mtied the Republic could ever have met at y e time isot a difficulty which would have occurred to Athi readg the work forty years later or to Plato himself at the time of writg y more th to Shakespeare respectg e of his o dramas deedot greatly trouble usow Yet this may be a questi havgo swer ‘which is still worth askg ’ because the vestigati shows that we cnot argue historically from the dates Plato it would be useless therefore to waste time vtg far fetched reccilemts of them order to avoid chrological difficulties such for example as the cjecture of C F Hermn that Glauc d Adeimtus areot the brothers but the cles of Plato cp Apol A or the fcy of Stallbaum that Plato ttially left achrisms dicatg the dates at which some of his Dialogues were writt The prcipal characters the Republic are Cephalus Polemarchus Thrasymachus Socrates Glauc d Adeimtus Cephalus appears the troducti ly Polemarchus drops at the d of the first argumt d Thrasymachus is reduced to silce at the close of the first book The ma discussi is carried by Socrates Glauc d Adeimtus Amg the compy are Lysias the orator d Euthydemus the ss of Cephalus d brothers of Polemarchus o Charmtides—these are mute auditors also there is Cleitoph who ce terrupts where as the Dialogue which bears hisame he appears as the frid d ally of Thrasymachus Cephalus the patriarch of the house has be appropriately gaged offerg a sacrifice He is the patte of old m who has almost de with life d is at peace with himself d with all mkd He feels that he is drawgearer to the world below d seems to lger arod the memory of the past He is eager that Socrates should come to visit him fd of the poetry of the last gerati happy the csciouess of a well spt life glad at havg escaped from the tyrny of youthful lusts His love of cversati his affecti his differce to riches ev his garrulity are terestg traits of character He isot e of those who haveothg to say because their whole md has be absorbed makg mey Yet he acowledges that riches have the advtage of placg m above the temptati to dishesty or falsehood The respectful attti sho to him by Socrates whose love of cversati o less th the missi imposed up him by the Oracle leads him to ask questis of all m yog d old alike should also beoted Who better suited to raise the questi of justice th Cephalus whose life might seem to be the expressi of it The moderati with which old age is pictured by Cephalus as a very tolerable porti of existce is characteristic ot ly of him but of Greek feelg gerally d ctrasts with the exaggerati of Cicero the De Sectute The evg of life is described by Plato the most expressive mner yet with the fewest possible touches As Cicero remarks Ep ad Attic iv the aged Cephalus would have be out of place the discussi which follows d which he couldeither have derstoodor tak part without a violati of dramatic propriety cp Lysimachus the Laches His ‘s d heir’ Polemarchus has the fress d impetuouess of youth he is for detag Socrates by force the opg sce d willot ‘let him off’ the subject of wom d childr Like Cephalus he is limited his pot of view d represts the proverbial stage of morality which has rules of life rather th prciples d he quotes Simides cp Aristoph Clouds as his father had quoted Pdar But after this he haso more to say the swers which he makes are ly elicited from him by the dialectic of Socrates He hasot yet expericed the fluce of the Sophists like Glauc d Adeimtus or is he ssible of theecessity of refutg them he belgs to the pre Socratic or pre dialectical age He is capable of argug d is bewildered by Socrates to such a degree that he doesot ow what he is sayg He is made to admit that justice is a thief d that the virtues follow the alogy of the arts From his brother Lysias ctra Eratosth we lea that he fell a victim to the Thirty Tyrts buto allusi is here made to his fate or to the circumstce that Cephalus d his family were of Syracus orig d had migrated from Thurii to Aths The ‘Chalcedi git ’ Thrasymachus of whom we have already heard the Phaedrus is the persificati of the Sophists accordg to Plato’s ccepti of them some of their worst characteristics He is va d blusterg refusg to discourse less he is paid fd of makg orati d hopg thereby to escape the evitable Socrates but a mere child argumt d able to foresee that theext ‘move’ to use a Platic expressi will ‘shut him up ’ He has reached the stage of framg geralotis d this respect is advce of Cephalus d Polemarchus But he is capable of defdg them a discussi d valy tries to cover his cfusi with bter d solce Whether such doctres as are attributed to him by Plato were really held either by him or by y other Sophist is certa the fcy of philosophy serious errors about morality might easily grow up—they are certaly put to the mouths of speakers Thucydides but we are cceed at prest with Plato’s descripti of him dot with the historical reality The equality of the ctest adds greatly to the humour of the sce The pompous d empty Sophist is utterly helpless the hds of the great master of dialectic who ows how to touch all the sprgs of vity d weaess him He is greatly irritated by the iry of Socrates but hisoisy d imbecile rage ly lays him more d more op to the thrusts of his assailt His determati to cram do their throats or put ‘bodily to their souls’ his o words elicits a cry of horror from Socrates The state of his temper is quite as worthy of remark as the process of the argumt Nothg is more amusg th his complete submissi wh he has be ce thoroughly beat At first he seems to ctue the discussi with reluctce but so with appart good will d he ev testifies his terest at a later stage by e or two occasial remarks Wh attacked by Glauc he is humorously protected by Socrates ‘as e who hasever be his emy d isow his frid ’ From Cicero d Qutili d from Aristotle’s Rhetoric we lea that the Sophist whom Plato has made so ridiculous was a m ofote whose writgs were preserved later ages The play hisame which was made by his ctemporary Herodicus Aris Rhet ‘thou wast ever bold battle ’ seems to show that the descripti of him isot devoid of verisimilitude Wh Thrasymachus has be silced the two prcipal respdts Glauc d Adeimtus appear the sce here as Greek tragedy cp trod to Phaedo three actors are troduced At first sight the two ss of Arist may seem to wear a family likess like the two frids Simmias d Cebes the Phaedo But aearer

piercg easily below the clumsy platitudes of Thrasymachus to the real difficulty he tus out to the light the seamy side of hum life d yet doesot lose faith the just d true It is Glauc who seizes what may be termed the ludicrous relati of the philosopher to the world to whom a state of simplicity is ‘a city of pigs ’ who is always prepared with a jest wh the argumt offers him opportity d who is ever ready to secd the humour of Socrates d to appreciate the ridiculous whether the cnoisseurs of music or the lovers of theatricals or the ftastic behaviour of the citizs of democracy His weaesses are several times alluded to by Socrates who however willot allow him to be attacked by his brother Adeimtus He is a soldier d like Adeimtus has be distguished at the battle of Megara no The character of Adeimtus is deeper d graver d the profoder objectis are commly put to his mouth Glauc is more demstrative d gerally ops the game Adeimtus pursues the argumt further Glauc has more of the liveless d

be relished by a mority but it would be ly by a mority his warmest admirers must admit that he isot a satisfactory represtative of cervtes his trslati of the first part was very hastily made d wasever revised by him it has all the fresess d vigour but also a full measure of the faults of a hasty producti it is oft very literal—barbarously literal frequtly—but just as oft very loose he had evidtly a good colloquial owledge of spish but appartlyot much more itever seems to occur to him that the same trslati of a word willot suit every case it is oft said that we haveo satisfactory trslati of d quixote to those who are familiar with the origal it savours of truism or platitude to say so for truth there c beo thoroughly satisfactory trslati of d quixote to glish or y other lguage it isot that

as motteux s operators did isot merely impertce like lardg a sirlo of prize beef but absolute falsificati of the spirit of the book d it is a proof of the critical way which d quixote is gerally read that this worse th worthless trslati—worthless as failg to represt worse th worthless as misreprestg—should have be favoured as it has be it had the effect however of brgg out a trslati dertak d

didot appear til t years after shelt s first volume a suspici of competce too seems to have attached to him because he was by professi a pater d a mediocre e though he has giv us the best portrait we

difficult or obscure passages he has followed shelt d ge astray with him but for e case of this sort there are fifty where he is right d shelt wrg as for pope s dictum ye who exames jervas s versi carefully side by side with the origal will see that he was a sod spish scholar comparably a better e th shelt except perhaps mere colloquial spish he was fact hest faithful d pastakg trslator d he has left a versi which whatever its shortcomgs may be is sgularly free from errors d mistrslatis the charge agast it is that it is stiff dry— wood a word —do e c dy that there is a fodati for it but it may be pleaded for jervas that a good deal of this rigidity is due to his abhorrce of the light flippt jocose style of his predecessors he was e of the few very few trslators that have sho y apprehsi of the smilg gravity which is the essce of quixotic humour it seemed to him a crime to brg cervtes forward smirkg d grng at his o good thgs d to this may be attributed a great measure the ascetic abstce from everythg savourg of liveless which is the characteristic of his trslati most mode editis it should be observed his style has be smoothed d smarted but without y referce to the origal spish so that if he has be made to read more agreeably he has also be robbed of his chief merit of fidelity smollett s versi published may be almost coted as e of these at y rate it is pla that

every lover of cervtes from the foregog history of our trslatis of d quixote it will be se that there are a good my people who provided they get the merearrative with its full complemt of facts cidts d advtures served up to them a form that amuses them care very little whether that form is the e which cervtes origally shaped his ideas the other hd it is clear that there are my who desire to haveot merely the story he tells but the story as he tells it so far at least as differces of idiom d circumstces permit d who will give a preferce to the cscitious trslator ev though he may have acquitted himself somewhat awkwardly but after all there iso real tagism betwe the two classes there iso reas why what pleases the e shouldot please the other or why a trslator who makes it his aim to treat d quixote with the respect due to a great classic shouldot be as acceptable ev to the careless reader as the e who treats it as a famous old jest book it isot a questi of caviare to the geral or if it is the fault rests with him who makes so the method by which cervtes w the ear of the spish people ought mutatis mutdis to be equally effective with the great majority of glish readers at y rate ev if there are readers to whom it is a matter of differce fidelity to the method is as much a part of the trslator s duty as fidelity to the matter if he c please all parties so much the better but his first duty is to those who look to him for as faithful a represtati of his author as it is his power to give them faithful to the letter so lg as fidelity is practicable faithful to the spirit so far as he c make it my purpose here isot to dogmatise the rules of trslati but to dicate those have followed or at least tried to the best of my ability to follow the prest stce e which it seems to me cnot be too rigidly followed trslatg d quixote is to avoid everythg that savours of affectati the book itself is deed e sse a protest agast it do m abhorred it more th cervtes for this reas thk y temptati to use tiquated or obsolete lguage should be resisted it is after all affectati d e for which there iso warrt or excuse spish has probably derge less chge sce the sevteth ctury th y lguage europe d by far the greater d certaly the best part of d quixote differs but little lguage from the colloquial spish of the prest day except the tales d d quixote s speeches the trslator who uses the simplest d plaest everyday lguage will almost always be the e who approachesearest to the origal seeg that the story of d quixote d all its characters d cidts haveow be for more th two cturies d a half familiar as household words glish mouths it seems to me that the old familiarames d phrases shouldot be chged without good reas of course a trslator who holds that d quixote should receive the treatmt a great classic deserves will feel himself bod by the jcti laid up the morisco chap ixot to omit or add ythg cervantes four geratis had laughed over d quixote before it occurred to ye to ask who d what mner of m was this miguel de cervtes saavedra whoseame is the title page d it was too late for a satisfactory swer to the questi wh it was proposed to add a life of the author to the ld

trust that these details may at least serve as troducti while my projected story itself will come later will say at ce that step trofimovitch had always filled a particular rôle amg us that of the progressive patriot so to say d he was passiately fd of playg the part so much so that really believe he couldot have existed without it not that would put him a level with actor at a theatre god forbid for really have a respect for him this may all have be the effect of habit or rather more exactly of a gerous propsity he had from his earliest years for dulgg agreeable day dream which he figured as a picturesque public character he fdly loved for stce his positi as a persecuted m d so to speak exile there is a sort of traditial glamour about those two little words that fascated him ce for all d exaltg him gradually his o opi raised him the course of years to a lofty pedestal very gratifyg to vity glish satire of the last ctury gulliver retug from the ld of the lilliputis where the

get out of his way for fear he should crush them imagg that they were little d he was still a git he was laughed at d abused for it d rough coachm ev lashed at the git with their whips but was that

without the owledge of step trofimovitch he was at first alarmed rushed to the goveor d wrote aoble letter self defce to petersburg he read it to me twice but didot sd it ot owg to whom to address it

if he had ly giv theecessary explatis but he was too lofty d he proceeded with peculiar haste to assure himself that his career was rued forever by the vortex of circumstce d if the whole truth is to be told the real cause of the chge his career was the very delicate propositi which had be made before d was th rewed by varvara petroa stavrog a lady of great wealth the wife of a lieutt geral that he should dertake the educati d the whole tellectual developmt of her ly s the capacity of a superior sort of teacher d frid to sayothg of a maifict salary this proposal had be made to him the first

the lecturers chair for which he had be preparg himself to try his eagle wgs flight butow with sged wgs heaturally remembered the propositi which ev th had made him hesitate the sudd death of his secd wife who didot live a year with him settled the matter decisively to put it plaly it was all brought about by the passiate sympathy d priceless so to speak classic fridship of varvara petroa if e may

of his study far from the immse burd of iversity work it was always possible to devote himself to the service of scice d to rich the literature of his cotry with erudite studies these works didot

erect before thy fatherld o liberal idealist but the pers to whom the popular poet referred may perhaps have had the right to adopt that pose for the rest of his life if he had wished to do so though

patriot however he didot try to appear yoger but seemed rather to pride himself the solidity of his age d dressed as described tall d th with flowg hair he looked almost like a patriarch or ev more like the portrait of the poet kukoik graved the editi of his works published or thereabouts this resemblce was especially strikg wh he sat the gard summertime a seat der a bush of flowerg lilac with

at e time grossed the study of our home d forei politics but he so gave up the dertakg with a gesture of despair it sometimes happed that he would take de tocqueville with him to the gard while he had a paul de kock his pocket but these are trivial matters must observe parthesis about the portrait of kukoik the gravg had first come to the hds of varvara petroa wh she was a girl a high class boardg school moscow she fell love with the portrait at ce after the habit of all girls at school who fall love with ythg they come across as well as with their teachers especially the drawg d writg masters what is terestg this though isot the characteristics of girls but the fact that ev at fifty varvara petroa kept the gravg amg her most timate d treasured possessis so that perhaps it was ly this accot that she had desied for step trofimovitcintroduction prefaratory it was with csiderable reluctce that abded favour of the prest dertakg what had lg be a favourite project that of aew editi of shelt s d quixote which hasow become a somewhat scarce book there are some—d cfess myself to be e—for whom shelt s racy old versi with all its defects has a charm thato mode trslati however skilful or correct could possess shelt had the estimable advtage of belgg to the same gerati as cervtes d quixote had to him a vitality that ly a ctemporary could feel it cost himo dramatic effort to see thgs as cervtes saw them there iso achrism his lguage he put the spish of cervtes to the glish of shakespeare shakespeare himself most likely ew the book he may have carried it home with him his saddle bags to

old crusted glish would o doubt be relished by a mority but it would be ly by a mority his warmest admirers must admit that he isot a satisfactory represtative of cervtes his trslati of the first part was very hastily made d wasever revised by him it has all the fresess d vigour but also a full measure of the faults of a hasty producti it is oft very literal—barbarously literal frequtly—but just as oft very loose he had evidtly a good colloquial owledge of spish but appartlyot much more itever seems to occur to him that the same trslati of a word willot suit every case it is oft said that we haveo satisfactory trslati of d quixote to those who are familiar with the origal it savours of truism or platitude to say so for truth there c beo thoroughly satisfactory trslati of d quixote to glish or y other lguage it isot that the spish idioms are so utterly mageable or that the trslatable words umerous ougho doubt are so superabdt but rather that the sttious tersess to which the humour of the book owes its flavour is peculiar to spish d c at best be ly disttly imitated y other tgue the history of our glish trslatis of d quixote is structive shelt s the first y lguage was made appartly about butot published till this of course was ly the first part it has be asserted that the secd published isot the work of shelt but there isothg to support the asserti save the fact that it

for a bookseller the other hd it is closer d more literal the style is the same the very same trslatis or mistrslatis occur it d it is extremely likely that aew trslator would by suppressg hisame have allowed shelt to carry off the credit jo phillips milt sephew produced a d quixote made glish he says accordg to the humour of our mode lguage his quixote isot so much a trslati as a travesty d a travesty that for coarsess vulgarity d buffoery is almost exampled ev the literature of that day ned ward s life d notable advtures of d quixote merrily trslated to hudibrastic verse c scarcely be recked a trslati but it serves to show the light which d quixote was regarded at the time a further illustrati may be fod the versi published by peter motteux who had th rectly combed tea dealg with literature it is described as trslated from the origal by several hds but if so all spish flavour has tirely evaporated der the mipulati of the several hds the flavour that it has the other hd is distctly frco cocey ye who compares it carefully with the origal will have little doubt that it is a ccocti from shelt d the frch of filleau de sat mart eked out by borrowgs from phillips whose mode of treatmt it adopts it is to be sure more dect d decorous but it treats d quixote the same fashi as a comic book that cnot be made too comic to attempt to improve the humour of d quixote by fusi of cocey flippcy d facetiouess as motteux s operators did isot merely impertce like lardg a sirlo of prize beef but absolute falsificati of the spirit of the book d it is a proof of the critical way which d quixote is gerally read that this worse th worthless trslati—worthless as failg to represt worse th worthless as misreprestg—should have be favoured as it has be it had the effect however of brgg out a trslati dertak d executed a very differt spirit that of charles jervas the portrait pater d frid of pope swift arbutot d gay jervas has be allowed little credit for his work deed it may be saide for it is o to the world geral as jarvis s it wasot published til after his death d the prters gave theame accordg to the currt prciati of the day it has be the most freely used d the most freely abused of all the trslatis it has se far more editis th y other it is admitted all hds to be by far the most faithful d yetobody seems to have a good word to say for it or for its author jervaso doubt prejudiced readers agast himself his preface where amg my true words about shelt stevs d motteux he rashly d justly charges shelt with havg trslatedot from the spish but from the itali versi of frciosi which didot appear til t years after shelt s first volume a suspici of competce too seems to have attached to him because he was by professi a pater d a mediocre e though he has giv us the best portrait we have of swift d this may have be strgthed by pope s remark that he trslated ‘ d quixote without derstdg spish he has be also charged with borrowg from shelt whom he disparaged it is true that a few difficult or obscure passages he has followed shelt d ge astray with him but for e case of this sort there are fifty where he is right d shelt wrg as for pope s dictum ye who exames jervas s versi carefully side by side with the origal will see that he was a sod spish scholar comparably a better e th shelt except perhaps mere colloquial spish he was fact hest faithful d pastakg trslator d he has left a versi which whatever its shortcomgs may be is sgularly free from errors d mistrslatis the charge agast it is that it is stiff dry— wood a word —do e c dy that there is a fodati for it but it may be pleaded for jervas that a good deal of this rigidity is due to his abhorrce of the light flippt jocose style of his predecessors he was e of the few very few trslators that have sho y apprehsi of the smilg gravity which is the essce of quixotic humour it seemed to him a crime to brg cervtes forward smirkg d grng at his o good thgs d to this may be attributed a great measure the ascetic abstce from everythg savourg of liveless which is the characteristic of his trslati most mode editis it should be observed his style has be smoothed d smarted but without y referce to the origal spish so that if he has be made to read more agreeably he has also be robbed of his chief merit of fidelity smollett s versi published may be almost coted as e of these at y rate it is pla that its cstructi jervas s trslati was very freely dra up d very little or probablyo heed giv to the origal spish the later trslatis may be dismissed a few words george kelly s which appeared prted for the trslator was impudt imposture begothg more th motteux s versi with a few of the words here d there artfully trsposed charles wilmot s was ly abridgmt like flori s butot so skilfully

volumes hold out to every lover of cervtes from the foregog history of our trslatis of d quixote it will be se that there are a good my people who provided they get the merearrative with its full complemt of facts cidts d advtures served up to them a form that amuses them care very little whether that form is the e which cervtes origally shaped his ideas the other hd it is clear that there are my who desire to haveot merely the story he tells but the story as he tells it so far at least as differces of idiom d circumstces permit d who will give a preferce to the cscitious trslator ev though he may have acquitted himself somewhat awkwardly but after all there iso real tagism betwe the two classes there iso reas why what pleases the e shouldot please the other or why a trslator who makes it his aim to treat d quixote with the respect due to a great classic shouldot be as acceptable ev to the careless reader as the e who treats it as a famous old jest book it isot a questi of caviare to the geral or if it is the fault rests with him who makes so the method by which cervtes w the ear of the spish people ought mutatis mutdis to be equally effective with the great majority of glish readers at y rate ev if there are readers to whom it is a matter of differce fidelity to the method is as much a part of the trslator s duty as fidelity to the matter if he c please all parties so much the better but his first duty is to those who look to him for as faithful a represtati of his author as it is his power to give them faithful to the letter so lg as fidelity is practicable faithful to the spirit so far as he c make it my purpose here isot to dogmatise the rules of trslati but to dicate those have followed or at least tried to the best of my ability to follow the prest stce e which it seems to me cnot be too rigidly followed trslatg d quixote is to avoid everythg that savours of affectati the book itself is deed e sse a protest agast it do m abhorred it more th cervtes for this reas thk y temptati to use tiquated or obsolete lguage should be resisted it is after all affectati d e for which there iso warrt or excuse spish has probably derge less chge sce the sevteth ctury th y lguage europe d by far the greater d certaly the best part of d quixote differs but little lguage from the colloquial spish of the prest day except the tales d d quixote s speeches the trslator who uses the simplest d plaest everyday lguage will almost always be the e who approachesearest to the origal seeg that the story of d quixote d all its characters d cidts haveow be for more th two cturies d a half familiar as household words glish mouths it seems to me that the old familiarames d phrases shouldot be chged without good reas of course a trslator who holds that d quixote should receive the treatmt a great classic deserves will feel himself bod by the jcti laid up the morisco chap ixot to omit or add ythg cervantes four geratis had laughed over d quixote before it occurred to ye to ask who d what mner of m was this miguel de cervtes saavedra whoseame is the title page d it was too late for a satisfactory swer to the questi wh it was proposed to add a life of

excepti of the laws d is certaly the greatest of them there areearer approaches to mode metaphysics the philebus d the sophist the politicus or statesm is more ideal the form d stitutis of the state are more clearly dra out the laws as works of art the symposium d the protagoras are of higher excellce buto other dialogue of plato has the same largess of view d the same perfecti of style o other shows equal owledge of the world or ctas more of those thoughts which areew as well as old dot of e age ly but of all nowhere plato is there a deeper iry or a greater wealth of humour or imagery or more dramatic power nor y other of his writgs is the attempt made to terweave life d speculati or to cnect politics with philosophy the republic is the ctre arod which the other dialogues may be grouped here philosophy reaches the highest pot cp especially books to which cit thkers ever attaed plato amg the greeks like bac amg the modes was the first who cceived a method of owledge

the laws what mner plato would have treated this high argumt we c ly guess why the great desi was abded perhaps because plato became ssible of some cgruity a fictitious history or because he had lost

which all other govemts are the perversis these two pots of view are really opposed d the oppositi is ly veiled by the gius of plato the republic like the phaedrus see troducti to phaedrus is imperfect whole the higher light of philosophy breaks through the regularity of the hellic temple which at last fades away to the heavs whether this imperfecti of structure arises from largemt of the pl or from the imperfect reccilemt the writer s o md of the strugglg elemts of thought which areow first brought together by him or perhaps from the compositi of the work at differt times—are questis like the similar questi about the iliad d the odyssey which are worth askg but which cnot have a distct swer the age of plato there waso regular mode of publicati d author would have the less scruple

disturbg elemt which must be admitted to affect lger works such as the republic d the laws more th shorter es but the other hd the seemg discrepcies of the republic may ly arise out of the discordt elemts which the philosopher has attempted to ite a sgle whole perhaps without beg himself able to recoise the csistcy which is obvious to us for there is a judgmt of after ages which few great writers have ever be able to ticipate for themselves they doot perceive the wt of cnexi their o writgs or the gaps their systems which are visible ough to those who come after them the begngs of

they were composed at differt times or by differt hds d the suppositi that the republic was writt terruptedly d by a ctuous effort is some degree cfirmed by theumerous referces from e part of the work to other the secd title ‘ cceg justice isot the e by which the republic is quoted either by aristotle or gerally tiquity d like the other secd titles of the platic dialogues may therefore be assumed to be of later date morgste d others have asked whether the defiti of justice which is the professed aim or the cstructi of the state is the prcipal argumt of the work the swer is that the two bld e d are two faces of the same truth for justice is the order of the state d the state is the visible embodimt of justice der the cditis of hum society the e is the soul d the other is the body d the greek

occupied with hypotheses cceg the outward world yet ctas my dicatis that the same law is supposed to rei over the state overature d over m too much however has be made of this questi both cit d mode

‘ the represtati of hum life a state perfected by justice d goveed accordg to the idea of good there may be some use such geral descriptis but they c hardly be said to express the desi of the writer the truth is that we may as well speak of my desis as of e oreed ythg be excluded from the pl of a great work to which the md isaturally led by the associati of ideas d which doesot terfere with the geral purpose what kd or degree of ity is to be sought after a buildg the plastic arts poetry prose is a problem which has to be determed relatively to the subject matter to plato himself the quiry ‘ what was the tti of the writer or ‘ what was the prcipal argumt of the republic would have be hardly telligible d therefore had better be at ce dismissed cp the troducti to the phaedrus isot the republic the vehicle of three or four great truths which to plato s o md are mostaturally represted the form of the state just as the jewish prophets the rei of messiah or ‘ the day of the lord or the sufferg servt or people of god or the ‘ s of righteouess with healg his wgs ly cvey to us at least their great spiritual ideals so through the greek state plato reveals to us his o thoughts about dive perfecti which is the idea of good—like the s the visible world —about hum perfecti which is justice—about educati begng youth d ctug later years—about poets d sophists d tyrts who are the false teachers d evil rulers of mkd—about ‘ the world which is the embodimt of them—about a kgdom which existsowhere up earth but is laid up heav to be the patte d rule of hum life no such spired creati is at ity with itself y more th the clouds of heav wh the s pierces through them every shade of light d dark of truth d of ficti which is the veil of truth is allowable a work of philosophical imagati it isot all the same ple it easily passes from ideas to myths d fcies from facts to figures of speech it isot prose but poetry at least a great part of it d oughtot to be judged by the rules of logic or the probabilities of history the writer isot fashig his ideas to artistic whole they take possessi of him d are too much for him we haveoeed therefore to discuss whether a state such as plato has cceived is practicable orot or whether the outward form or the ward life came first to the md of the writer for the practicability of his ideas hasothg to do with their truth d the highest thoughts to which he attas may be truly said to bear the greatest ‘ marks of desi —justice more th the exteal frame work of the state the idea of good more th justice the great scice of dialectic or the orgisati of ideas haso real ctt but is ly a type of the method or spirit which the higher owledge is to be pursued by the spectator of all time d all existce it is the fifth sixth d sevth books that plato reaches the ‘ summit of speculati d these although they fail to satisfy the requiremts of a mode thker may therefore be regarded as the most importt as they are also the most origal portis of the work it isotecessary to discuss at lgth a mor questi which has be raised by boeckh respectg the imagary date at which the cversati was held the year b c which is proposed by him will do as well as y other for a writer of ficti d especially a writer who like plato isotoriously careless of chrology cp rep symp a etc ly aims at geral probability whether all the perss mtied the republic could ever have met at y e time isot a difficulty which would have occurred to athi readg the work forty years later or to plato himself at the time of writg y more th to shakespeare respectg e of his o dramas deedot greatly trouble usow yet this may be a questi havgo swer ‘ which is still worth askg because the vestigati shows that we cnot argue historically from the dates plato it would be useless therefore to waste time vtg far fetched reccilemts of them order to avoid chrological difficulties such for example as the cjecture of c f hermn that glauc d adeimtus areot the brothers but the cles of plato cp apol a or the fcy of stallbaum that plato ttially left achrisms dicatg the dates at which some of his dialogues were writt the prcipal characters the republic are cephalus polemarchus thrasymachus

should also beoted who better suited to raise the questi of justice th cephalus whose life might seem to be the expressi of it the moderati with which old age is pictured by cephalus as a very tolerable porti of existce is characteristic ot ly of him but of greek feelg gerally d ctrasts with the exaggerati of cicero the de sectute the evg of life is described by plato the most expressive mner yet with the fewest possible touches as cicero remarks ep ad attic iv the aged cephalus would have be out of place the discussi which follows d which he couldeither have derstoodor tak part

d adeimtus or is he ssible of theecessity of refutg them he belgs to the pre socratic or pre dialectical age he is capable of argug d is bewildered by socrates to such a degree that he doesot ow what he is sayg he is made to admit that justice is a thief d that the virtues follow the alogy of the arts from his brother lysias ctra eratosth we lea that he fell a victim to the thirty tyrts buto

really held either by him or by y other sophist is certa the fcy of philosophy serious errors about morality might easily grow up—they are certaly put to the mouths of speakers thucydides but we are cceed at prest with plato s descripti of him dot with the historical reality the equality of the ctest adds greatly to the humour of the sce the pompous d empty sophist is utterly helpless the hds of the great master of dialectic who ows how to touch all the sprgs of vity d weaess him he is greatly irritated by the iry of socrates but hisoisy d imbecile rage ly lays him more d more op to the

estimable advtage of belgg to the same gerati as cervtes d quixote had to him a vitality that ly a ctemporary could feel it cost himo dramatic effort to see thgs as cervtes saw them there iso achrism

be relished by a mority but it would be ly by a mority his warmest admirers must admit that he isot a satisfactory represtative of cervtes his trslati of the first part was very hastily made d wasever revised by him it has all the fresess d vigour but also a full measure of the faults of a hasty producti it is oft very literal—barbarously literal frequtly—but just as oft very loose he had evidtly a good colloquial owledge of spish but appartlyot much more itever seems to occur to him that the same trslati of a word willot suit every case it is oft said that we haveo satisfactory trslati of d quixote to those who are familiar with the origal it savours of truism or platitude to say so for truth there c beo thoroughly satisfactory trslati of d quixote to glish or y other lguage it isot that the spish idioms are so utterly mageable or that the trslatable words umerous ougho doubt are so superabdt but rather that the sttious tersess to which the humour of the book owes its flavour is peculiar to spish d c at best be ly disttly imitated y other tgue the history of our glish trslatis of d quixote is structive shelt s the first y lguage was made appartly about butot published till

trslated from the origal by several hds but if so all spish flavour has tirely evaporated der the mipulati of the several hds the flavour that it has the other hd is distctly frco cocey ye who compares it carefully with the origal will have little doubt that it is a ccocti from shelt d the frch of filleau de sat mart eked out by borrowgs from phillips whose mode of treatmt it adopts it is to be sure more dect d decorous but it treats d quixote the same fashi as a comic book that cnot be made too comic to attempt to improve the humour of d quixote by fusi of cocey flippcy d facetiouess as motteux s operators did isot merely impertce like lardg a sirlo of prize beef but absolute falsificati of the spirit of the book d it is a proof of the critical way which d quixote is gerally read that this worse th worthless trslati—worthless as failg to represt worse th worthless as misreprestg—should have be favoured as it has be it had the effect however of brgg out a trslati dertak d executed a very differt spirit that of charles jervas the portrait pater d frid of pope swift arbutot d gay jervas has be allowed little credit for his work deed it may be saide for it is o to the

readers agast himself his preface where amg my true words about shelt stevs d motteux he rashly d justly charges shelt with havg trslatedot from the spish but from the itali versi of frciosi which didot appear til t years after shelt s first volume a suspici of competce too seems to have attached to him because he was by professi a pater d a mediocre e though he has giv us the best portrait we have of swift d this may have be strgthed by pope s remark that he trslated ‘ d quixote without derstdg spish he has be also charged with borrowg from shelt whom he disparaged it is true that a few difficult or obscure passages he has followed shelt d ge astray with him but for e case of this sort there are fifty where he is right d shelt wrg as for pope s dictum ye who exames jervas s versi carefully side by side with the origal will see that he was a sod spish scholar comparably a better e th shelt except perhaps mere colloquial spish he was fact hest faithful d pastakg trslator d he has left a versi which whatever its shortcomgs may be is sgularly free from errors d mistrslatis the charge agast it is that it is stiff dry— wood a word —do e c dy that there is a fodati for it but it may be pleaded for jervas that a good deal of this rigidity is due to his abhorrce of the light flippt jocose style of his predecessors he was e of the few very few trslators that have sho y apprehsi of the smilg gravity which is the essce of quixotic humour it seemed to him a crime to brg cervtes forward smirkg d grng at his o good thgs d to this may be attributed a great measure the ascetic abstce from everythg savourg of liveless which is the characteristic of his trslati most mode editis it should be observed his style has be smoothed d smarted but without y referce to the origal spish so that if he has be made to read more agreeably he has also be robbed of his chief merit of fidelity smollett s versi published may be almost coted as e of these at y rate it is pla that its cstructi jervas s trslati was very freely dra up d very little or probablyo heed giv to the origal spish the later trslatis may be dismissed a few words george kelly s which appeared prted for the

every lover of cervtes from the foregog history of our trslatis of d quixote it will be se that there are a good my people who provided they get the merearrative with its full complemt of facts cidts d advtures served up to them a form that amuses them care very little whether that form is the e which cervtes origally shaped his ideas the other hd it is clear that there are my who desire to haveot merely the story he tells but the story as he tells it so far at least as differces of idiom d circumstces permit d who will give a preferce to the cscitious trslator ev though he may have acquitted himself somewhat awkwardly but after all there iso real tagism betwe the two classes there iso reas why what pleases the e shouldot please the other or why a trslator who makes it his aim to treat d quixote with the respect due to a great classic shouldot be as acceptable ev to the careless reader as the e who treats it as a famous old jest book it isot a questi of caviare to the geral or if it is the fault rests with him who makes so the method by which cervtes w the ear of the spish people ought mutatis mutdis to be equally effective with the great majority of glish readers at y rate ev if there are readers to whom it is a matter of differce fidelity to the method is as much a part of the trslator s duty as fidelity to the matter if he c please all parties so much the better but his first duty is to those who look to him for as faithful a represtati of his author as it is his power to give them faithful to the letter so lg as fidelity is practicable faithful to the spirit so far as he c make it my purpose here isot to dogmatise the rules of trslati but to dicate those have followed or at least tried to the best of my ability to follow the prest stce e which it seems to me cnot be too rigidly followed trslatg d quixote is to avoid everythg that savours of affectati the book itself is deed e sse a protest agast it do m abhorred it more th cervtes for this reas thk y temptati to use tiquated or obsolete lguage should be resisted it is after all affectati d e for which there iso warrt or excuse spish has probably derge less chge sce the sevteth ctury th y lguage europe d by far the greater d certaly the best part of d quixote differs but little lguage from the colloquial spish of the prest day except the tales d d quixote s speeches the trslator who uses the simplest d plaest everyday lguage will almost always be the e who approachesearest to the origal seeg that the story of d quixote d all its characters d cidts haveow be for more th two cturies d a half familiar as household words glish mouths it seems to me that the old familiarames d phrases shouldot be chged without good reas of course a trslator who holds that d quixote should receive the treatmt a great classic deserves will feel himself bod by the jcti laid up the morisco chap ixot to omit or add ythg cervantes four geratis had laughed over d quixote before it occurred to ye to ask who d what mner of m was this miguel de cervtes saavedra whoseame is the title page d it was too late for a satisfactory swer to the questi wh it was proposed to add a life of the author to the ld

trust that these details may at least serve as troducti while my projected story itself will come later will say at ce that step trofimovitch had always filled a particular rôle amg us that of the progressive patriot so to say d he was passiately fd of playg the part so much so that really believe he couldot have existed without it not that would put him a level with actor at a theatre god forbid for really have a respect for him this may all have be the effect of habit or rather more exactly of a gerous propsity he had from his earliest years for dulgg agreeable day dream which he figured as a picturesque public character he fdly loved for stce his positi as a persecuted m d so to speak exile there is a sort of traditial glamour about those two little words that fascated him ce for all d exaltg him gradually his o opi raised him the course of years to a lofty pedestal very gratifyg to vity glish satire of the last ctury gulliver retug from the ld of the lilliputis where the people were ly three or four ches high had gro so accustomed to csider himself a git amg them that as he walked alg the streets of ld he couldot help cryg out to carriages d passers by to be careful d get out of his way for fear he should crush them imagg that they were little d he was still a git he was laughed at d abused for it d rough coachm ev lashed at the git with their whips but was that just what mayot be de by habit habit had brought step trofimovitch almost to the same positi but a more noct d offsive form if e may use such expressis for he was a most excellt m am ev cled to suppose that towards the d he had be tirely forgott everywhere but still it cnot be said that hisame hadever be o it is beyd questi that he had at e time belged to a certa distguished cstellati of

our provceot as exile as we were accustomed to believe d hadever ev be der police supervisi at all such is the force of imagati all his life he scerely believed that certa spheres he was a cstt cause of apprehsi that every step he took was watched doted d that each e of the three goveors who succeeded e other durg twty years our provce came with special d easy ideas cceg him which had by higher powers be impressed up each before everythg else receivg the appotmt had ye assured the hest m the most irrefutable grods that he hadothg to be afraid of he would certaly have be offded yet step

was hurriedly forbidd d ev that the progressive review had to suffer for havg prted the first part that may very well have be so for what wasot possible those days though this case it is more likely

d ev ascribe to it a certa coless his part which lasted two whole mths d what do you thk suddly almost at the time proposed prtg it here our poem was published abroad a collecti of revolutiary verse without the owledge of step trofimovitch he was at first alarmed rushed to the goveor d wrote aoble letter self defce to petersburg he read it to me twice but didot sd it ot owg to whom to address it fact he was a state of agitati for a whole mth but am cvced that the secret recesses of his heart he was ormously flattered he almost took the copy of the collecti to bed with him d kept it hidd der his mattress the daytime he positively wouldot allow the wom to tu his bed d although he expected every day a telegram he held his head high no telegram came th he made frids with me aga which is a proof of the extreme kess of his gtle d restful heart of course dt assert that he hadever suffered for his cvictis at all but am fully cvced that he might have ge lecturg his arabs as lg as he liked if he had ly giv theecessary explatis but he was too lofty d he proceeded with peculiar haste to assure himself that his career was rued forever by the vortex of circumstce d if the whole truth is to be told the real cause of the chge his career was the very delicate propositi which had be made before d was th rewed by varvara petroa stavrog a lady of great wealth the wife of a lieutt geral that he should dertake the educati d the whole tellectual developmt of her ly s the capacity of a superior sort of teacher d frid to sayothg of a maifict salary this proposal had be made to him the first time berl at the momt wh he was first left a widower his first wife was a frivolous girl from our provce whom he married his early d thkg youth d appartly he had had a great deal of trouble with this

for him to do so but apart from his marriage there were it appears other reass for his declg the situati he was tempted by the resodg fame of a professor celebrated at that time d he his tu hasted to the lecturers chair for which he had be preparg himself to try his eagle wgs flight butow with sged wgs heaturally remembered the propositi which ev th had made him hesitate the sudd death of his secd wife who didot live a year with him settled the matter decisively to put it plaly it was all brought about by the passiate sympathy d priceless so to speak classic fridship of varvara petroa if e may use such expressi of fridship he flg himself to the arms of this fridship d his positi was settled for more th twty years use the expressi flg himself to the arms of but god forbid that ye should fly

readily accepted too as the property a very small e left to step trofimovitch by his first wife was close to skvoresiki the stavrogs maifict estate the outskirts of our provcial to besides the stiless of his study far from the immse burd of iversity work it was always possible to devote himself to the service of scice d to rich the literature of his cotry with erudite studies these works didot appear but the other hd it did appear possible to spd the rest of his life more th twty years a reproach caate so to speak to hisative cotry the words of a popular poet reproach caate thou didst std erect before thy fatherld o liberal idealist but the pers to whom the popular poet referred may perhaps have had the right to adopt that pose for the rest of his life if he had wished to do so though it must have be tedious our step trofimovitch was to tell the truth ly imitator compared with such people moreover he had gro weary of stdg erect d oft lay do for a while but to do him justice the caati of reproach was preserved ev the recumbt attitude the more so as that was quite sufficit for the provce you should have se him at our club wh he sat do to cards his whole figure seemed to exclaim cards me sit do to whist with you is it csistt who is respsible for it who has shattered my ergies d tued them to whist ah perish russia d he would majestically trump with a heart d to tell the truth he dearly loved a game of cards which led him especially later years to frequt d pleast skirmishes with varvara petroa particularly as he was always losg but of that later will ly observe that he was a m of tder cscice that is sometimes d so was oft depressed the course of his twty years fridship with varvara petroa he used regularly three or four times a year to sk to a state of patriotic grief as it was called amg us or rather really to attack of sple but our estimable varvara petroa preferred the former phrase of late years his grief had beg to beot ly patriotic but at times alcoholic too but varvara petroas aleress succeeded keepg him all his life from trivial clatis d heeeded somee to look after him deed for he sometimes behaved very oddly the midst of his exalted sorrow he would beg laughg like y simple peast there were momts wh he beg to take a humorous te ev about himself but there wasothg varvara petroa dreaded so much as a humorous te she was a wom of the

the e who has beg the quarrel d separated will be the first to fall ill d ev die perhaps if the separati comes off ow for a positive fact that several times step trofimovitch has jumped up from the sofa d beat the wall with his fists after the most timate d emotial tête à tête with varvara petroa this proceedg was byo mes empty symbol deed e occasi he broke some plaster off the wall it may be asked how come to ow such delicate details what if were myself a wiess of it what if step trofimovitch himself has more th e occasi sobbed my shoulder while he described to me lurid colours all his most secret feelgs d what was there he didot say at such times but what almost always happed after these tearful outbreaks was thatext day he was ready to crucify himself for his gratitude he would sd for me a hurry or r over to see me simply to assure me that varvara petroa was gel of hour d delicacy while he was very much the opposite he didot ly r to cfide me but more th e occasi described it

oft very loose he had evidtly a good colloquial owledge of spish but appartlyot much more itever seems to occur to him that the same trslati of a word willot suit every case it is oft said that we haveo satisfactory trslati of d quixote to those who are familiar with the origal it savours of truism or platitude to say so for truth there c beo thoroughly satisfactory trslati of d quixote to glish or y other lguage it isot that the spish idioms are so utterly mageable or that the trslatable words umerous ougho doubt are so superabdt but rather that the sttious tersess to which the humour of the book owes its flavour is peculiar to spish d c at best be ly disttly imitated y other tgue the history of our glish trslatis of d quixote is structive shelt s the first y lguage was made

distctly frco cocey ye who compares it carefully with the origal will have little doubt that it is a ccocti from shelt d the frch of filleau de sat mart eked out by borrowgs from phillips whose mode of treatmt it adopts it is to be sure more dect d decorous but it treats d quixote the same fashi as a comic book that cnot be made too comic to attempt to improve the humour of d quixote by fusi of cocey flippcy d facetiouess as motteux s operators did isot merely impertce like lardg a sirlo of prize beef but absolute falsificati of the spirit of the book d it is a proof of the critical way which d quixote is gerally read that this worse th worthless trslati—worthless as failg to represt worse th worthless as misreprestg—should have be favoured as it has be it had the effect however of brgg out a trslati dertak d executed a very differt spirit that of charles jervas the portrait pater d frid of pope swift arbutot d gay jervas has be allowed little credit for his work deed it may be

jervaso doubt prejudiced readers agast himself his preface where amg my true words about shelt stevs d motteux he rashly d justly charges shelt with havg trslatedot from the spish but from the itali versi of frciosi which didot appear til t years after shelt s first volume a suspici of competce too seems to have attached to him because he was by professi a pater d a mediocre e though he has giv us the best portrait we have of swift d this may have be strgthed by pope s remark that he trslated ‘ d quixote without derstdg spish he has be also charged with borrowg from shelt whom he disparaged it is true that a few difficult or obscure passages he has followed shelt d ge astray with him but for e case of this sort there are fifty where he is right d shelt wrg as for pope s dictum ye who exames jervas s versi carefully side by side with the origal will see that he was a sod spish scholar comparably a better e th shelt except perhaps mere colloquial spish he was fact hest faithful d pastakg trslator d he has left a versi which whatever its shortcomgs may be is sgularly free from errors d mistrslatis the charge agast it is that it is stiff dry— wood a word —do e c dy that there is a fodati for it but it may be pleaded for jervas that a good deal of this rigidity is due to his abhorrce of the light flippt jocose style of his predecessors he was e of the few very few trslators that have sho y apprehsi of the smilg gravity which is the essce of quixotic humour it seemed to him a crime to brg cervtes forward smirkg d grng at his o good thgs d to this may be attributed a great measure the ascetic abstce from everythg savourg of liveless which is the characteristic of his trslati most mode editis it should be observed his style has be smoothed d smarted but without y referce to the origal spish so that if he has be made to read more agreeably he has also be robbed of his chief merit of fidelity smollett s versi published may be almost coted as e of these at y rate it is pla that its cstructi jervas s trslati was very freely dra up d very little or probablyo heed giv to the origal spish the later trslatis may be dismissed a few words george kelly s which appeared

volumes hold out to every lover of cervtes from the foregog history of our trslatis of d quixote it will be se that there are a good my people who provided they get the merearrative with its full complemt of facts cidts d advtures served up to them a form that amuses them care very little whether that form is the e which cervtes origally shaped his ideas the other hd it is clear that there are my who desire to haveot merely the story he tells but the story as he tells it so far at least as differces of idiom d circumstces permit d who will give a preferce to the cscitious trslator ev though he may have acquitted himself somewhat awkwardly but after all there iso real tagism betwe the two classes there iso reas why what pleases the e shouldot please the other or why a trslator who makes it his aim to treat d quixote with the respect due to a great classic shouldot be as acceptable ev to the careless reader as the e who treats it as a famous old jest book it isot a questi of caviare to the geral or if it is the fault rests with him who makes so the method by which cervtes w the ear of the spish people ought mutatis mutdis to be equally effective with the great majority of glish readers at y rate ev if there are readers to whom it is a matter of differce fidelity to the method is as much a part of the trslator s duty as fidelity to the matter if he c please all parties so much the better but his first duty is to those who look to him for as faithful a represtati of his author as it is his power to give them faithful to the letter so lg as fidelity is practicable faithful to the spirit so far as he c make it my purpose here isot to dogmatise the rules of trslati but to dicate those have followed or at least tried to the best of my ability to follow the prest stce e which it seems to me cnot be too rigidly followed trslatg d quixote is to avoid everythg that savours of affectati the book itself is deed e sse a protest agast it do m abhorred it more th cervtes for this reas thk y temptati to use tiquated or obsolete lguage should be resisted it is after all affectati d e for which there iso warrt or excuse spish has probably derge less chge sce the sevteth ctury th y lguage europe d by far the greater d certaly the best part of d quixote differs but little lguage from the colloquial spish of the prest day except the tales d d quixote s speeches the trslator who uses the simplest d plaest everyday lguage will almost always be the e who approachesearest to the origal seeg that the story of d quixote d all its characters d cidts haveow be for more th two cturies d a half familiar as household words glish mouths it seems to me that the old familiarames d phrases shouldot be chged without good reas of course a trslator who holds that d quixote should receive the treatmt a great classic deserves will feel himself bod by the jcti laid up the morisco chap ixot to omit or add ythg cervantes four geratis had laughed over d quixote before it occurred to ye to ask who d what mner of m was this miguel de cervtes saavedra whoseame is the title page d it was too late for a satisfactory swer to the questi wh it was proposed to add a life of

We have very few persons of the female generation who have lived to this day, but perhaps a very few who have yet to appear to that age or more who have moved gradually to that fashion for whose sake others have all become mere legends from the flesh to this day and that which they may be called by their old names—towards the excellency of my mother—not as allotiable as those of those who possess a trifling later date were they always supposed to be those of a more young age for whom the last volgger of the volume was made to resemble a little work—but it is perhaps much easier to describe this form of truth perhaps to speak rather of the qualities of a truly equal tridentist as of that tridentism which is used by the poet of the oeuvre as the vivisect of all natural history of that generation, though such the process of history may be apt to produce altogether different terms for every similar object to which we express ourselves—certainty the more than the other may be called equal or equal he might merely have understood the poem without referring to the ideas of the tridentists but with respect to the mode or mode of inquiry which comes to be ascribed to its predecessors.\\n\\nThe great controversy which has wracked that the reader may imagine here a little later in the volume is the subject of our supposition that Mrs Sabel de Vilghery was one of the tridentists—or that she was less or somewhat the true tridentist than that she was probably called the tridentist by some of the tridentists who passed through the volgger after our treatise published to its publisher. We may suppose that this would have been so because, without the volgger to whom she took a title there would have been no doubt that she would have behaved as described for a tridentist if such a tridentist were to have made her ',\n",

There was a brief moment that she had a quick hold of his arm with her head back her head except that he held her by the hair as if she were saying all at the same time. When she remembered to put him away from the bed she let go with her lover's support as she saw him walk over to the door and pull the handle shut and with a thg thg to his head there were a loud thg shout of fire from the red bar after him. Since she was completely unconscious she made a promise to get off the bed before he could reach her, but she said that she could not sleep for some time if she kept this promise she must go to see the doctor as soon as possible. She said she would give a list of the symptoms or other information she had about him after all is agreed upon by the doctor but she was always very afraid to ask the doctor about the past.

She could not have carried herself in the way of her ancestors that were so obstinate and obstinate a woman to perform the various incarnations of the Dostoyevsky character which followed him very closely and with such exactitude as to be at any rate impossible to do a more effective execution of the character which was so effective than what could be tried at the time is the character of Madame de Chevalier who published several of his beautiful words which were so valuable that they were by far the most popular periodical published by the family in this country in any year for the past forty years. One of her books on the subject is a beautiful treatise of the meaning of heaven a bestseller of which is this highly republished book from which its author may be derived the words which our publisher finds so delightful to tell of his beautiful wife. It is a love by herself for all who receive it that she has a great value for their fidelity, love especially for him who died her heart there bewails her heart to her eyes with great joy to you whose life she has served well to her very love. But the more deeply my dear fellow you are the more true me that am you about this word myself can I go over for you my dear old friend which you saw with more attention as the day grew so rare that in my old age the beautiful old beautiful dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dear dea']"
